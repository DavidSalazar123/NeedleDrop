492,imperial triumphant - alphaville album review,"Listen: https://imperialtriumphant.lnk.to/AlphavilleTW

With Alphaville, Imperial Triumphant upholds its blend of extreme metal and jazz without sounding like a novelty.

Note: Sorry for not recognizing tracks 8 and 9 as bonus covers. They aren't labeled on some platforms, but I should've expected the unexpected from this band. Normally I don't take bonus tracks into account, but at least these two (despite arguably being the album's weakest) didn't detract very much from the experience. ""City Swine"" is still kind of a dud for me, and while I enjoy ""The Greater Good,"" in my opinion it doesn't make for the best closer either. But again, sorry for the oversight.

Equal parts absurd and revolutionary: This is Blarf.

Witness finds Katy Perry heading in exciting new sonic and lyrical directions, but is sometimes held back by Katy indulging in safer, staler sounds and her usual cliches.

4 years after Beach Fossils' great sophomore album Clash the Truth, the Brooklyn band has returned with their most lavish effort yet. I can still commend the band for not shamelessly trend-chasing like many of their dreamy, jangly contemporaries, but unfortunately the pastiche of '60s pop sounds they serve up here isn't enough to distract from some pretty bland songwriting.

1836,deadmau5 - while (1 is less than 2) album review,"Listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpspgp3QQqo

Deadmau5' new, double album showcases much more finesse and maturity than his past releases. His usual house bangers are dark, textured. Meanwhile, much of the second disc feels like it was inspired by some in-depth listens to a film score or two.

Schoolboy Q might not be an amazing lyricist, and his new album might have a handful of filler hooks, but Oxymoron also shows him riding a variety of beats with an impressive level of precision. Not only that, but a number of tracks here bring back the grit and vulgarity of 90s gangsta rap, and give it a progressive instrumental backdrop.

I've been on the fence about many albums this year, but this is one of the few where I'm torn. For every great moment on the new Arcade Fire record, there's one that falls incredibly short of whatever stylistic mark the band was shooting for. Rather than deliver another cohesive set of songs, Reflektor embarks upon a stylistic hodgepodge full of hits and misses.

On her debut, Rings, I was pretty impressed with the seductive songwriting and primal rhythms that made their way into the songs of Caren Mesirow, a.k.a. Glasser. While her music was obviously influenced, it was still really enjoyable. Interiors changes things in that regard, however. This time around, Cameron seems to be drowning in her love of one particular artist: Björk.

AFI's Burials is the latest in a long string of uninteresting records from this California band. While I'm not a big fan of the group's early stuff, at least LPs like Sing The Sorrow had a modicum of aggression or excitement. The radio-friendly records the band has been dropping as of late have really been doing nothing for me, and Burials is possibly the least entertaining of all of them.

Loaded with insipid lyrics, amateur singing, and childish melodies, it's pretty clear the the pop duo known as Cults has no desire whatsoever to mature their sound. There's definitely more ambition on this record on the instrumental side; featuring an increase in instrumental layers. However, what ends up making Static a sophomore slump for this indie buzz alum is its serious lack of single power.

As Fuzz, Ty Segall and Charlie Moothart bring the incredibly high level of distortion and energy you'd expect from a Ty-affiliated album. However, there are a slew of different factors keeping this record from sticking out in Ty's ever-growing discography: production, songwriting, vocals. All of these things keep Fuzz from feeling like a truly distinct moment--even though Ty and Charlie are shooting for an entirely different style of rock on this record. While I did like much of what Fuzz had to offer, the lack of finer details and ambition keep this LP from having much shelf life for me, honestly.

1998,of montreal - lousy with sylvianbriar album review,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2013/09/of-montreal-belle-glade-missionaries/

of Montreal's latest record sees the band stripping things back to some pretty base instrumentation, resulting in a sound that's pretty similar to the band's early work. However, Kevin Barnes proves he's still a pretty manic songwriter, consistently delivering wordy, witty, and intense lyrics in his trademark vocals.

Rapper Danny Brown returns with Old. It's an album that mirrors the Detroit native's constant cycle of drug-fueled partying and remorse that was introduced on 2011's XXX. The major difference this time around being heavier instrumentals and Danny's split personalities feeling even more at odds.

Daniel Lopatin's latest full-length sees him stepping away from the extreme sampling that made 2011's Replica so thrilling. Instead, he rests on his passion for tightly sequenced synths, and there are some somewhat engaging results.

Also, I said ""Chrome County"" instead of ""Chrome Country"" when mentioning the closing track of this album like a fool. I'm sorry. :-S

Toronto rapper Drake is back with his 3rd commercial release, Nothing Was The Same. Here, Drake continues with his lyrical obsession with the tattered relationships of his past, which is fine, but he hops on a gauntlet of nutty trap beats on this LP that are less than flattering to his clean-cut persona.

2043,all pigs must die - nothing violates this nature album review (quick),"Listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQeVVYJaq0o

While I think this sophomore album is the most intense effort from All Pigs Must Die thus far, again, I'm finding a lot of the riffs and vocals to be a little on the bland side when it comes to this kind of heavy, metallic hardcore punk style.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

2064,black sabbath - 13 album review,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVfUimq2KeI

On 13, Black Sabbath's return with a nearly original lineup isn't as treacherous as I assumed it would be. Aside from some overly compressed guitars, the songwriting and performances are quite good.

Mount Kimbie took a real risk on this latest full-length of theirs, Cold Spring Fault Less Youth. The duo has seen fit to bring a lot more live instrumentation into the fold, which has definitely brought some dynamics to their sound; however, the recording itself lies pretty flat. If only the sounds were as bold as Kimbie's stylistic change.

Judging from tracks like ""Gold Soul Theory,"" New York's the Underachievers certainly have style and vision; however, they don't display it on every single track on this new mixtape--which really does feel like a smattering of different sounds and messages. It's the spacier and more spiritual tracks that go over best, and I hope that's the angle that maintains the most strength as these guys work toward their next major project.

On its second full-length album, Local Natives still sits in the shadow of bands like Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, which is something even the band's most hardcore fans are willing to admit. I guess the issue is that I personally feel the group doesn't take its very obvious influences and twist them into something that feels distinct to the band. There's not much in the way of personality, melody, or sound that's hooking me here. I can understand if music fans want to hear more of a certain kind of sound--I guess this is just now the sound I""m looking to hear more of.

This new P.O.S record will probably please a lot of fans. Stefon did work to groom his style, and bring a succinct set of tracks that are easy to take in, but a lot of the instrumentals here--outside of ""Bumper"" and ""Fire In the Hole / Arrow to the Action""--don't match the revolutionary attitude Stefon's lyrics portray.

Deftones make a lighter and more ethereal left turn with their latest album, much like they did with Saturday Night Wrist in 2006, but the end result is nowhere near as experimental or expansive, unfortunately. Though much of the songwriting is enjoyable here, for this most part, this album feels like Deftones are playing it a little safe.

Brian Eno's latest ambient effort sees him returning to his roots in the genre with albums like Ambient 1.

Some of the most notably cringe-worthy lyrics from this album:

Known to act a donkey on the camel toe
Then take the camel toe and turn it into casserole

Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone

Rev your mirror, shake it like a stipper ho!
Car so big it got a stripper pole

Going so hard you'd think I mixed a Viagra with a Soda

That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese like I'm taking pictures

She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr..Scrr.. Wrists moving, cookin' to it

I am so high...attic
I am so high like an...addict

Got a move that will break your leg, know what I'm talking about
Known to kill pussy, nigga chalk it out

2 gun bang
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane

On Mount Eerie's latest effort, Phil Elverum managest to transform is usual sounds and emotions into a repetitive, drone-y, and sometimes ambient musical experience. Mostly, it's beautiful, but a few moments felt a bit overlong to me. Plus, despite being well over 40 minutes, I didn't come away from this album feeling completely satisfied with the songs and material I was dealt. Still, it's a very solid album. Phil keeps the sounds of Mount Eerie potent, strange, and emotionally affecting while changing things up enough to keep his musical trajectory interesting for longtime fans.

While a few singles in this style aren't bad, B.o.B overdoes it a bit by making nearly every track shoot for some kind of pre-chewed, radio-friendly sound. The end result is an album that doesn't feel all that personal or engaging. Rather, it's pretty one-size-fits all.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

""How Come You Never Go There"" review: 
http://theneedledrop.com/2011/08/feist-home-come-you-never-go-there/

On her latest album, Metals, Canadian singer-songwriter Leslie Feist brings a set of songs that feel much older than the tracks that were on her last album, the Reminder. That album was released only four years ago, but Metals' dreary, grey aesthetic makes the distance between these two albums feel so much wider.

Wild Flag's self-titled debut album is a light, fun, and upbeat reformation for these indie rock veterans. I think some longtime fans--especially those in the Sleater-Kinney camp--will expect a little bit more. That's fine and understandable. I feel the same way to an extent. 

However, after several listens, the simplicity of this album no longer bugged me. Instead, it made this album catchy and invigorating. These ladies know what complicated music is, and this project is obviously a conscious effort to make something more straightforward, you know?

This album is a handful of tracks that aim straight for those looking to shake hips, sway shoulders, and raise fists.

Ah, the new Opeth record. Was I expecting to like this? No. Was I hoping I'd like this? Yes! A big, fat ""yes,"" actually.

I've never been an Opeth fan. Their melodic and almost overproduced take on death metal--and progressive metal, generally--just doesn't have anything I look for in music. 

I was surprised by the classic progressive rock direction the band took this album in, though. The syncopated guitars, drums, and organs are a serious treat to listen to on a lotta these tracks. The acoustic interludes in these songs transition into louder moments really gracefully, too. The production ain't bad, but I'm still being held back by one major snag: the vocals.

Yes, the vocals just do nothing whatsoever for me. They just don't portray any personality to me. Opeth has always had some decent death growls, but the cleaner vocals don't hook me at all.

With an almost unmeasurable poetic bitterness, Andrew Jackson Jihad are as sharp as ever on their new album, Knife Man. As usual, the music here is about the lyrics. The chord progressions are familiar copies of folk songs and punk tunes. Hell, some of the songs even sound similar to tracks from the band's previous album.

Still, the lyrics here throw me into fits of laughter and depression. These tracks make me swing back and forth like an emotional pendulum. That's the show of a great Andrew Jackson Jihad album. Well, to me, anyway.

Sad to say, I'm not big on this new Neon Indian album. I'd like to think that it's not because of the hype that was built around the project's last album, Psychic Chasms, but I'm afraid that might be a possibility.

I don't think I was expecting the world of this album--especially since the last album didn't give me the world. To put it simply, I guess I was expecting something different. To me, this album feels like a serious and well-recorded version of Psychic Chasms.

On some level, I consider myself a fan of Wolves In the Throne Room: the Olympia, Washington black metal outfit. If I wasn't, I don't think I would have followed their exploits up until this point. I don't see myself quitting, but I wasn't as into Celestial Lineage as I thought I would be. 

It's not for lack of trying, or for a lack of ambition, though. Wolves In the Throne Room do their damnedest to makes this sound like a new record, throwing in more female vocals, harp, sound effects, and synthesizers. 

The issue for me is that these songs sound a little so similar to what this band has been doing for its past three albums. The way these songs are written is just keeping this release from sounding, well, new to me.

The Men's latest album, Leave Home, has some pretty abrasive, heavy, and eye-widening production on it. This straight-to-tape recording features some great guitar distortion: and the total package is so thick and saturated, it makes this album an extremely heavy and overbearing experience.

Another breath of fresh air here is the amount of variation that these guys throw into this album. Leave Home basically sees three people sharing songwriting duties, so it's not surprising to see this album coming out a little scatterbrained. Still, it's nice to hear an album that's this loud seem basically impossible to pigeonhole.

The sad part is that the Men write their tunes with some of the most forgettable and deja vu-inspiring guitar riffs imaginable. I know nothing is original these days. I'm fine with that. But that doesn't mean a more originality wouldn't have helped this album stand out in my mind a bit more.

2463,the drums- portamento album review,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/07/the-drums-money-2/

The Drums' sophomore release, Portamento, was an album I was pretty excited for. The group's self-titled debut contained some of my favorite singles of last year, and I was hoping the same would happen with this release.

Maybe my love of the last album lead to some unrealistic expectations, but at least some of them were met. Overall, this album feels a little more mature, and the recording is noticeably better. Plus, the band seems a little more confident in its style, sticking to a similar ""twanged-out"" sound for every track--with the exception of the synth odyssey that is ""Searching For Heaven.""

Unfortunately, this has lead to a group of tracks that just feel, well, the same. I never assumed the Drums' debut to have a ton of variation, but this album made me realize just how much it did. Together, these tracks, in my opinion, weaken one another a little bit.

Shlohmo's Bad Vibes is a nice set of thirteen beats that will chill out just about any situation. The music here functions on different levels of listening. They're great as ambient backdrops, but can be explored actively as well.

2465,hella- tripper album review,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/08/stream-hellas-tripper/

Stylistically, I think Tripper is an exciting return to Hella's old, stripped down form. Some fans may see it as a bit of a regression, but that's only half of the truth. The duo throws in some overdubbed guitars and bass, and manages to utilize some of the tricks they've learned working in various side-projects since the release of 2007's There's No 666 In Outer Space. There are moments on here where I actually feel could have made it onto a Zach Hill solo album.

The downside is, though I do think Hella is sounding pretty fierce on this album, the songs are filtered through a pretty weak recording. The guitars and drums sound tinny, flat, and claustrophobic. It's hardly the range of lows and highs I'd want in order to appreciate the intricate, detailed performances laced into this album. 

Despite that unforgettable pothole, I like a good chunk of the tracks on here. I can't say I hated any, but I was left feeling like this was just another Hella record in some spots. However, I wouldn't want to hear anybody make a Hella record but Hella.

One of the longest-running acts in alternative rock has a new album out, Considering I grew up with a lotta this band's stuff on the radio, I thought I'd be a little more excited to hear the Chili Peppers have a new album out, Sadly, I wasn't, but I'm glad you guys pointed my ears in the direction of this LP via many, many requests.

Though I wasn't in love with the whole thing, I got a nice blast of nostalgia from this LP, which reminded me of what I love most about this band: Great vocals and strong grooves. Though this album sees the band dealing with a pretty notable lineup change, they make the best of it by venturing into less familiar territory.

I'm happy that old dogs are learning new tracks on this album, but not every tick has been perfected. While an acoustic guitar intro on the third track works really well, I'm at a loss with other spots on this LP that feature bossa nova sounds, a drum machine, and some narrated vocals.

This band isn't gonna take the changes they face lying down. I like that. Though I'm not in love with every track here, I like that.

Dan Barrett's latest project, a full-length album and book, is both a personal and fictional exploration of death, suicide, depression, and the afterlife. Because of that, this video takes a look at both the music and the book that comes with this package.

If anything makes the tracks on this CD stand out, it's the atmosphere. Dan Barrett has a somewhat messy production style, but like any Mount Eerie album, it lends this project an interesting sound you're not gonna hear anywhere else.

With one track after another being slathered in reverb, there are moments on here that remind me of Grizzly Bear's 2007 album Yellow House. However, there's a disturbing aura surrounding this album, which the book empowers.

Though there are some standout songs on this release, I like to take it as more of an experience--not just an assembly of tracks. Because to me, this album stirs up the same emotions any great piece of horror or science fiction would. Those emotions are filtered through a singer-songwriter lens, and it somehow works.

Active Child's sophomore release has some pretty haunting and beautiful sounds. Lone member Pat Grossi's choir boy falsetto is undeniably good. Plus, all the effects he laces into these tracks makes this LP an interesting listen.

While I'm not in love with every song on this LP, the sounds are stellar. In my opinion, what's best are the couple tracks where Active Child embraces the sound of experimental R&B. That's an idea I'd love to hear explored further.

Track review from May: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/05/africa-hitech-gangslap/

It took a while for Africa Hitech's debut LP to grow on me. When the album originally came out in May, I took some favorites from it, but dismissed the rest as being too hectic to be really enjoyable.

However, I found myself just itching to listen to this thing again at the beginning of this month. To my surprise, I ended up loving the album from front to back. I still think some of the sounds could have been mixed a little better, but I love the rigid and primal mix of African and electronic sounds that flow throughout this LP. This isn't your average fusion of these two worlds, believe me.

On her sophomore album, Chelsea Wolfe brings together ten pieces of straight up darkness. But what makes the dreary, depressing feelings on this album so palatable is that Wolfe attacks this darkness from multiple angles with noise rock guitars, doom metal riffs, ambient soundscapes, smooth beats, and blood-curdling snarls.

While all the songs head roughly in the same direction, they find various ways to do it without adding up to an album that feels disjointed or scatterbrained.

New York's Cerebral Ballzy have a lot of energy and rage, but I still don't know what exactly is causing all of it. It's just my opinion, but I didn't find much to get enraged over in the lyrics on this album. Being told where to pee should be the least of society's worries.

There are bellyaches aimed toward cops and authority on this album, but the fish these songs do fry are small ones. There's nothing that boldly points at things like corruption or even police brutality. The lyrics just cry out against the same restrictions a parent might put on a toddler. If Cerebral Ballzy had a rap sheet, I'd guess it would be filled mostly with counts of loitering, vandalism, and petty theft. 

Aside from the thrashy riffs and great production, I guess I don't see a lot of purpose in this record. I know that's a very personal thing, but what reviews of mine aren't simply just my personal view.

On Watch the Throne, Kanye and Jay-Z team up for a celebration I'm sure their fans are going to love. The heavyweight MCs celebrate their relevancy, fame, and popularity with one track after another--occasionally stopping to make an introspective or societal observation. While the idea of the album is great, not every song is as fantastic as the next. 

No matter which songs seem appealing on this album, there are bound to be some that pale in comparison since this album is a little scatterbrained when it comes to beat and lyrical quality. 

Kanye and Jay-Z take this thing in numerous directions, relying on their celebrity status to carry the album forward. Kanye and Jay-Z relying on their star power isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I've loved a lot of music these guys have put out in the past, but my love stops there. I'm not in love with these guys as celebs or personalities, and I think--on some level--maybe a listener has to be in order to get complete enjoyment out of this album.

I was sure all this waiting would result in something bigger and better, but the ambition needed for that doesn't surface on the Rip Tide. It just seems like business as usual. Maybe this would have been acceptable as a release between Gulag and Flying, but the arrangements and foreign flavors of Beirut have held much more water on previous releases, and enhanced the Beirut experience.

This compilation features 15 cuts from a time span of several years in Nigeria's musical history. It was a time when Phonodisk, a record label looking to engineer hits, started promoting Nigerian bands playing with some sounds that were big in the West at the time: disco and funk.

Some of the tracks here are produced so well, and are a perfect recreation the formula that produced so many chart-topping hits. Others have the basic elements, but are hilariously off the mark. Honesty, I don't know who told some of these people they could sing. I'm looking at you Amel Addmore.

Though there are some sideshows and missteps, a majority of the tracks on here are pretty solid. Sometimes the foreign charm even helps the track out, which is the case for tracks like ""Big Race,"" ""Boys and Girls,"" and ""Music Alone.""

It's a fun compilation. Just don't go into it expecting every track to be gold.

There are moments tracks influenced by the world of wonky hip hop instrumentals--you know, the kinda stuff Brainfeeder drops on a regular basis--which is something this guys has always had a soft spot for.

But Machinedrum is very good about appealing to the winds of change whenever possible. And now that the sounds of dubstep and future garage are hot, he's trying his hand at recreating the sounds have have made names for guys like Burial.

Though Blackenedwhite isn't perfect, it's definitely a likeable release from this OFWGKTA-affiliated duo.

With Hodgy Beats on the mic and Left Brain building the beats, the tracks here offer up a series of fantasy raps about girls, weed, and guns. This is by no means an mind-blower of an album, but that's definitely made up for in simplicity and accessibility.

The beats here are a slight cut above what usually makes it onto an Odd Future-related album, and Hodgy Beats' mic skills are good, too.

Still, don't come in here expecting a mature personality ready to spit something highbrow. This album is much more primal. And part of what makes it a more refreshing release than Goblin is that it's not weighted down in internet drama and blog post bullshit. 

There are some undeniably good hip hop tracks on here. but do yourself a favor and try not to take this album too seriously. I highly doubt Hodgy Beats and Mike G play corners, and I don't think anybody in the Odd Future crew is a cop killer. As immature as this album can be, it's all for fun. Don't you remember being younger and wanting to say whatever you wanted? That's what attracted me to Bastard so much. This album walks along those lines, too, but with noticeably less consistency.

Oh, and get Left Brain to practice his mic skills, please.

If the rock history books stay accurate, Brooklyn's They Might Be Giants will go down as being one of the most idiosyncratic bands of all-time--even if that idiosyncrasy seems to wane a little bit on Join Us.

This record isn't completely devoid of fun or flavor. The Johns' usual buffet of strong melodies, catchy hooks, and esoteric lyrics is here. If anything on this album will keep longtime fans happy, it's that.

However, the sound here is really lacking the bold and kooky flavor I'm usually in line to be served. It sounds like something that would get plainly cited as a more mature direction. To me, it's just less. Less fun, less color, less spirit.

I wasn't offended by this album, and there's a good chunk of songs on here that are so good they make the sound of Join Us irrelevant. Still, not every track scratched that itch.

Alaska's Portugal. The Man made its Atlantic Records debut with this new album, In the Mountain In the Cloud. And because I didn't really like the band's past two albums, I'm surprised to see the music moving in a direction I like a lot more this time around.

The ambition that permeated from Portugal's earlier work is more present here. Though the band still feels it necessary to edit their songs heavily, structuring them down to the most simple of parts, the instrumentation is too big, bright, and joyous to not enjoy. Plus, the band does let go a bit on some of the songs here, allowing the music to wander indulgently and build tension.

It's not amazing me, but I'll take it.

2484,toxic holocaust- conjure and command album review,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/07/toxic-holocaust-nowhere-to-run/

On Toxic Holocaust's fourth album, the Portland band takes a leaner approach to its grimy fusion of punk and thrash metal, lowering the black metal influences that were once prominent on the band's earlier releases.

While there's not a lot of variety to be had on this release, it's not something I really ask for from this album. It's quick, 33-minute shot of rough riffs and tooth-gnashing ferocity.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

2485,the cool kids- when fish ride bicycles album review,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdzD5aJ7654

On the Cool Kids' full-length debut, When Fish Ride Bicycles, the Chicago duo pulls together some impressive beats and features. The great beats are to be expected, but things really deteriorate in the rapping and lyricism departments.

I know it's band to simply get hung up over the lyricism of this album, but it's really holding me back on this one. I know the Kids' earlier stuff wasn't the most lyrical material on the planet, but When Fish Ride is really an album for people who don't listen much to the lyrics. 

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too? How are you doing today?

On the band's sophomore album, Touche Amore generates some of the most empowering emotional hardcore I've heard in years. Yeah, the lyrics do make mountains out of emotional molehills, but the punk spirit powering the music is the same that made classics in this genre so, well, enjoyable.

On its latest album, Zombi throws guitars and bass to the wayside, and brings the focus back to the duo's foundation: drums and synths. It might just be the direction longtime fans wanted after the extremely rock-oriented Spirit Animal.

2488,the horrors- skying album review,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/07/stream-the-horrors-new-album/

On the Horrors third LP, the primary colors that combined to created the band's eccentric brand of post-punk start to fade a little bit; however, I think the move is sort of intentional.

Rather than sticking to their guns, the band is moving in a decidedly psychedelic and atmospheric direction with many tracks on Skying. And while their aren't any terrible tracks to be heard on this release, some of the results are underwhelming, admittedly.

Still, if you've been a fan of the band up until this point, there's no reason not to visit this release, because there are definitely some leaner and brighter songs to be heard among these ten tracks.

2489,kendrick lamar- section.80 album review,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/07/kendrick-lamar-hiiipower/

Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar doesn't follow the usual tough and hardened stereotypes that come with repping the California city. The guy isn't a wimp, but he's more interested in saying something thought-provoking than violent.

Backed by some fantastic beats, that's what every track on this new album, Section.80, boils down to: Food for thought. Whether the top is street violence, becoming famous, or where his generation is headed, Kendrick always has something substantial to say.

While a few tracks on here sound a little too corny for their own good, Section.80 is still a solid debut from the California kid.

2490,ulcerate- the destroyers of all album review,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohM8JU-VcX0

Ulcerate's latest album might not hit the spot for fans of the New Zealand group's more hectic material, but it definitely resonated with me. The relentless drumming and dissonant guitar passages create an ugly atmosphere that's ever-evolving. These guys display an extreme level of technical precision on each of these seven tracks, but the music isn't so flashy that it loses me. In fact, that precision manifests itself into a ton of interplay and some sick grooves that are almost too dizzying to follow.

It's a solid metal album. I may not be completely down with how it was mixed, but the performances are absolutely stellar. Definitely a heavy treat.

2491,herman dune- strange moosic album review,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/07/herman-dune-tell-me-something-i-dont-know/

France's Herman Dune has come correct with another batch of light, breezy indie folk tunes that make for a perfect summer listen. Like always, the band's frontman, David, brings these songs to live with his approachable voice and personality. 

To me, some songs really do pale in comparison to others, but albums with this kind of personality have always tended to wear thin with me a little bit. I bring this duo up because I think a lot of y'all might appreciate it more than I am.

2492,shabazz palaces- black up album review,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znDsRydk3_w

On Black Up, Shabazz Palaces take hip hop deep into the left field with odd beats and surreal effects. It's definitely an indulgent LP that requires a little bit of effort from the listener, but repeating these songs until they completely unfold is worth the wait.

Part of me is sure this album is going to warrant a lot of comments like, "" I don't usually listen to hip hop, but this is great!"" But that shouldn't discourage people who listen to the genre more regularly to check it out. Though this album sounds like it came outta nowhere, the artists on it haven't. Lazaro's experience goes way back to the 90s hip hop outfit Digable Planets, but exactly which planet he's on with this album is a hard question to answer.

if you're a fan of the mutant expressions from artists such as Zeroh, Quasimoto, or Madvillain, check it out. Defintiely something the Stones Throw or Brainfeeder heads will love.

2493,fucked up- david comes to life album review,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/05/fucked-up-queen-of-hearts-2/

On Fucked Up's new album, the band brings concept to the forefront for a group of songs that tell a dramatic tale of love and loss. It's pretty, well, complicated.

As ""epic"" as this story is, what makes it grandiose also kinda kills it for me, too. These songs make use of punk's trademark aggression and speed, but draws all the intensity out to a point where it no longer feels energetic, thrilling, cathartic, or any of the other things I look to this style of music for.

Which leads me to believe that it's just not for me. Maybe some of the more melodic moments could have gone over better if the vocals displayed as much dynamics, but the recording, instrumentation, and message are all pretty good.

For any punk fan, love it or hate it, it's at least worth a visit.

1. Das Racist MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2765
2. Ruby Coast album: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2762

Cut Copy's latest album is sweet, danceable, and good-natured. There's no denying that. But the personality on this album--or lack of it, really--is what prevents this album from sticking with me. The vocal melodies and lyrics are pretty underwhelming, and the grooves don't hit as hard as they could.

I'm not surprised this band is as popular as they are. They've got a clean and pleasant delivery; plus, their music is in league with a currently popular retro synthpop sound. But there's not much about this album that gets me truly, truly excited.

On Fergus & Geronimo's debut LP, the Texas duo tries their hand at doo wop, powerpop, and oddball garage tunes. Shockingly, they do it all pretty well.

Even though it's not stylistically consistent or extremely ambitious, F&G's wit and humor comes out in nearly every song, which is really what makes these tracks shine.
