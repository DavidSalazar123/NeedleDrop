With Alphaville, Imperial Triumphant upholds its blend of extreme metal and jazz without sounding like a novelty.

Note: Sorry for not recognizing tracks 8 and 9 as bonus covers. They aren't labeled on some platforms, but I should've expected the unexpected from this band. Normally I don't take bonus tracks into account, but at least these two (despite arguably being the album's weakest) didn't detract very much from the experience. ""City Swine"" is still kind of a dud for me, and while I enjoy ""The Greater Good,"" in my opinion it doesn't make for the best closer either. But again, sorry for the oversight.

703,Daniel Caesar - Case Study 01 ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCjuVIypPwA

Case Study 01 sounds much less polished and labored over than Freudian—perhaps in an attempt to catch lightning in a bottle—but, more often than not, the results are less than electric.

Comedian and actor Eric André's very own musical side-project serves up a wild, sample-based ride into the demented side of plunderphonics on Cease & Desist. Not only that, but this record also serves as a giant middle finger to the limitations modern copyright law places on artistic expression within the auditory realm. Equal parts absurd and revolutionary: This is Blarf.

Despite its overture, interludes, and finale, the new(ish) Black Lips album doesn't quite succeed at being some sort of grand statement. However, the band still has a killer sound and delivers a plethora of great tracks here.

1913,Avey Tare's Slasher Flicks - Enter The Slasher House ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_nHgrlZMCs

While this new Avey Tare record has some sweet melodies on it, nearly every piece of instrumentation on this thing is burnt to a crisp with effects. A lot like the latest Animal Collective record, this album is a little overdone, and could have benefited from taking the more orthodox approach the ""Little Fang"" single did.

1939,Migos - No Label II MIXTAPE REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.datpiff.com/Migos-No-Label-2-mixtape.579522.html

When it comes to loud, visceral trap rap, there are plenty of songs worth recommending on this new Migos mixtape. The problem is it's so packed with filler that finding the cartoony, eccentric, and occasionally hilarious gems on this thing can be a bit of a chore.

Schoolboy Q might not be an amazing lyricist, and his new album might have a handful of filler hooks, but Oxymoron also shows him riding a variety of beats with an impressive level of precision. Not only that, but a number of tracks here bring back the grit and vulgarity of 90s gangsta rap, and give it a progressive instrumental backdrop.

1984,Quelle Chris - Ghost At The Finish Line ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://mellomusicgroup.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-at-the-finish-line

Detroit rapper Quelle Chris isn't the most energetic MC, but his laid-back delivery approach is complemented with an eccentric cadence, thought-provoking bars, and some ridiculous song topics. If only his bold ideas were a little more well-organized, refined.

For every great moment on the new Arcade Fire record, there's one that falls incredibly short of whatever stylistic mark the band was shooting for. Rather than deliver another cohesive set of songs, Reflektor embarks upon a stylistic hodgepodge full of hits and misses.

While her music was obviously influenced, it was still really enjoyable. Interiors changes things in that regard, however. This time around, Cameron seems to be drowning in her love of one particular artist: Björk.

AFI's Burials is the latest in a long string of uninteresting records from this California band. While I'm not a big fan of the group's early stuff, at least LPs like Sing The Sorrow had a modicum of aggression or excitement. The radio-friendly records the band has been dropping as of late have really been doing nothing for me, and Burials is possibly the least entertaining of all of them.

Loaded with insipid lyrics, amateur singing, and childish melodies, it's pretty clear the the pop duo known as Cults has no desire whatsoever to mature their sound. There's definitely more ambition on this record on the instrumental side; featuring an increase in instrumental layers. However, what ends up making Static a sophomore slump for this indie buzz alum is its serious lack of single power.

2013,Fuzz - Self-Titled ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5xRq5f1kCU

As Fuzz, Ty Segall and Charlie Moothart bring the incredibly high level of distortion and energy you'd expect from a Ty-affiliated album. However, there are a slew of different factors keeping this record from sticking out in Ty's ever-growing discography: production, songwriting, vocals. All of these things keep Fuzz from feeling like a truly distinct moment--even though Ty and Charlie are shooting for an entirely different style of rock on this record. While I did like much of what Fuzz had to offer, the lack of finer details and ambition keep this LP from having much shelf life for me, honestly.

of Montreal's latest record sees the band stripping things back to some pretty base instrumentation, resulting in a sound that's pretty similar to the band's early work. However, Kevin Barnes proves he's still a pretty manic songwriter, consistently delivering wordy, witty, and intense lyrics in his trademark vocals.

2056,Candy Claws - Ceres & Calypso In The Deep Time ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2013/07/candy-claws-ceres-calypso-in-the-deep-time/

Candy Claws bring their fuzzy, lo-fi sound together with some creatively arranged psych pop instrumentation for a dream pop album that's musically and sonically dense. It's like biting into a juicy piece of pineapple the size of a tractor-trailer.

Mount Kimbie took a real risk on this latest full-length of theirs, Cold Spring Fault Less Youth. The duo has seen fit to bring a lot more live instrumentation into the fold, which has definitely brought some dynamics to their sound; however, the recording itself lies pretty flat. If only the sounds were as bold as Kimbie's stylistic change.

Judging from tracks like ""Gold Soul Theory,"" New York's the Underachievers certainly have style and vision; however, they don't display it on every single track on this new mixtape--which really does feel like a smattering of different sounds and messages.

2187,Local Natives - Hummingbird ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OGw6SwDveQ

On its second full-length album, Local Natives still sits in the shadow of bands like Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, which is something even the band's most hardcore fans are willing to admit. I guess the issue is that I personally feel the group doesn't take its very obvious influences and twist them into something that feels distinct to the band. There's not much in the way of personality, melody, or sound that's hooking me here. I can understand if music fans want to hear more of a certain kind of sound--I guess this is just now the sound I""m looking to hear more of.

This new P.O.S record will probably please a lot of fans. Stefon did work to groom his style, and bring a succinct set of tracks that are easy to take in, but a lot of the instrumentals here--outside of ""Bumper"" and ""Fire In the Hole / Arrow to the Action""--don't match the revolutionary attitude Stefon's lyrics portray.

With the third full-length LP since their reunion in '05, underground rock icons Dinosaur Jr. is doing what they usually do with the quality fans have come to expect. It's a bit more mellow than 2009's Farm, which has its ups and downs, but still very enjoyable to say the least.

2295,Jessie Ware- Devotion ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2012/07/jessie-ware-wildest-moments/

On her full-length debut, UK singer-songwriter Jessie Ware brings a somewhat modern approach to embracing the kinds of contemporary R&B sounds that were pretty hot in the 80s.

On this debut full-length Eprom explores some interesting musical ideas, bringing together the sounds of glitch hop, future garage, dubstep, and more. Frankly, there's not much the guy doesn't try out between these three tracks. But what kinda pulls them all together is that he maintains a certain simple subtlety on much of these tracks.

Some of the most notably cringe-worthy lyrics from this album:

Known to act a donkey on the camel toe
Then take the camel toe and turn it into casserole

Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone

Rev your mirror, shake it like a stipper ho!
Car so big it got a stripper pole

Going so hard you'd think I mixed a Viagra with a Soda

That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese like I'm taking pictures

She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr..Scrr.. Wrists moving, cookin' to it

I am so high...attic
I am so high like an...addict

Got a move that will break your leg, know what I'm talking about
Known to kill pussy, nigga chalk it out

2 gun bang
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane

So much money I had to let the banker count",465.0,188927,2012-08-16

On Mount Eerie's latest effort, Phil Elverum managest to transform is usual sounds and emotions into a repetitive, drone-y, and sometimes ambient musical experience. Mostly, it's beautiful, but a few moments felt a bit overlong to me. Plus, despite being well over 40 minutes, I didn't come away from this album feeling completely satisfied with the songs and material I was dealt. Still, it's a very solid album. Phil keeps the sounds of Mount Eerie potent, strange, and emotionally affecting while changing things up enough to keep his musical trajectory interesting for longtime fans.

On his sophomore release, B.o.B climbs further up the mainstream ladder by continuing to blend hip hop with some of the poppiest sounds imaginable. While a few singles in this style aren't bad, B.o.B overdoes it a bit by making nearly every track shoot for some kind of pre-chewed, radio-friendly sound. The end result is an album that doesn't feel all that personal or engaging. Rather, it's pretty one-size-fits all.

2458,Vektor- Outer Isolation ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/10/vektor-dying-world-dark-creations-dead-creators/

Vektor's latest album continues further down the road the Arizona band set for itself on 2009's Black Future. It's certainly a more dynamic and melodic release, but I was ultimately hoping for a stronger difference between this album and its predecessor. Still, these tunes embrace Vektor's usual sound without feeling stale.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

""How Come You Never Go There"" review: 
http://theneedledrop.com/2011/08/feist-home-come-you-never-go-there/

On her latest album, Metals, Canadian singer-songwriter Leslie Feist brings a set of songs that feel much older than the tracks that were on her last album, the Reminder. That album was released only four years ago, but Metals' dreary, grey aesthetic makes the distance between these two albums feel so much wider.

Wild Flag's self-titled debut album is a light, fun, and upbeat reformation for these indie rock veterans. I think some longtime fans--especially those in the Sleater-Kinney camp--will expect a little bit more. That's fine and understandable. I feel the same way to an extent. 

However, after several listens, the simplicity of this album no longer bugged me. Instead, it made this album catchy and invigorating. These ladies know what complicated music is, and this project is obviously a conscious effort to make something more straightforward, you know?

This album is a handful of tracks that aim straight for those looking to shake hips, sway shoulders, and raise fists.

Ah, the new Opeth record. Was I expecting to like this? No. Was I hoping I'd like this? Yes! A big, fat ""yes,"" actually.

I've never been an Opeth fan. Their melodic and almost overproduced take on death metal--and progressive metal, generally--just doesn't have anything I look for in music. 

I was surprised by the classic progressive rock direction the band took this album in, though. The syncopated guitars, drums, and organs are a serious treat to listen to on a lotta these tracks. The acoustic interludes in these songs transition into louder moments really gracefully, too. The production ain't bad, but I'm still being held back by one major snag: the vocals.

Yes, the vocals just do nothing whatsoever for me. They just don't portray any personality to me. Opeth has always had some decent death growls, but the cleaner vocals don't hook me at all.

With an almost unmeasurable poetic bitterness, Andrew Jackson Jihad are as sharp as ever on their new album, Knife Man. As usual, the music here is about the lyrics. The chord progressions are familiar copies of folk songs and punk tunes. Hell, some of the songs even sound similar to tracks from the band's previous album.

Still, the lyrics here throw me into fits of laughter and depression. These tracks make me swing back and forth like an emotional pendulum. That's the show of a great Andrew Jackson Jihad album. Well, to me, anyway.

If you love cute rock tunes with a dismal outlook on life, Veronica Falls might be the band for you. Their latest LP is simple, immediate, and catchy. I know it's easy to get down on something that sounds so easy to execute, but the energy and moody aesthetic that surround this band are something worth admiring to me.

They might not reinvent the styles of rock that influence them--twee and C86, I'm assuming--but they perform it with the fresh approach that the forefathers of this stuff did in the 80s.

Das Racist's Relax is a bit of a letdown for me. I just didn't enjoy it as much as the tapes. There are plenty of tracks here where the guys are their usual, hilarious selves.

Sad to say, I'm not big on this new Neon Indian album. I'd like to think that it's not because of the hype that was built around the project's last album, Psychic Chasms, but I'm afraid that might be a possibility.

I don't think I was expecting the world of this album--especially since the last album didn't give me the world. To put it simply, I guess I was expecting something different. To me, this album feels like a serious and well-recorded version of Psychic Chasms.

With a plethora of reverb and dance music sounds from the Neon Indian-related sideproject Vega. sole member Alan Palomo is reliving past glories more than he is excelling into the future.

On some level, I consider myself a fan of Wolves In the Throne Room: the Olympia, Washington black metal outfit. If I wasn't, I don't think I would have followed their exploits up until this point. I don't see myself quitting, but I wasn't as into Celestial Lineage as I thought I would be. 

It's not for lack of trying, or for a lack of ambition, though. Wolves In the Throne Room do their damnedest to makes this sound like a new record, throwing in more female vocals, harp, sound effects, and synthesizers. 

The issue for me is that these songs sound a little so similar to what this band has been doing for its past three albums. The way these songs are written is just keeping this release from sounding, well, new to me.

The Men's latest album, Leave Home, has some pretty abrasive, heavy, and eye-widening production on it. This straight-to-tape recording features some great guitar distortion: and the total package is so thick and saturated, it makes this album an extremely heavy and overbearing experience.

Another breath of fresh air here is the amount of variation that these guys throw into this album. Leave Home basically sees three people sharing songwriting duties, so it's not surprising to see this album coming out a little scatterbrained. Still, it's nice to hear an album that's this loud seem basically impossible to pigeonhole.

The sad part is that the Men write their tunes with some of the most forgettable and deja vu-inspiring guitar riffs imaginable. I know nothing is original these days. I'm fine with that. But that doesn't mean a more originality wouldn't have helped this album stand out in my mind a bit more.

Thundercat's debut full-length is a fantastically modernized tribute to the strain of jazz fusion that was coming out in the late 70s and early 80s. From George Duke to Jaco Pastorious, some of the genre's best and brightest musicians maintain a legacy through albums like this.

Though I was a little disappointed by the overall length of some of these tracks--c'mon, two minutes--the style, musicianship, and production are all great enough to keep me coming back to this release again and again.

2511,The Drums- Portamento ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/07/the-drums-money-2/

The Drums' sophomore release, Portamento, was an album I was pretty excited for. The group's self-titled debut contained some of my favorite singles of last year, and I was hoping the same would happen with this release.

Maybe my love of the last album lead to some unrealistic expectations, but at least some of them were met. Overall, this album feels a little more mature, and the recording is noticeably better. Plus, the band seems a little more confident in its style, sticking to a similar ""twanged-out"" sound for every track--with the exception of the synth odyssey that is ""Searching For Heaven.""

Unfortunately, this has lead to a group of tracks that just feel, well, the same. I never assumed the Drums' debut to have a ton of variation, but this album made me realize just how much it did. Together, these tracks, in my opinion, weaken one another a little bit.

Shlohmo's Bad Vibes is a nice set of thirteen beats that will chill out just about any situation. The music here functions on different levels of listening. They're great as ambient backdrops, but can be explored actively as well.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

2513,Hella- Tripper ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/08/stream-hellas-tripper/

Stylistically, I think Tripper is an exciting return to Hella's old, stripped down form. Some fans may see it as a bit of a regression, but that's only half of the truth. The duo throws in some overdubbed guitars and bass, and manages to utilize some of the tricks they've learned working in various side-projects since the release of 2007's There's No 666 In Outer Space. There are moments on here where I actually feel could have made it onto a Zach Hill solo album.

The downside is, though I do think Hella is sounding pretty fierce on this album, the songs are filtered through a pretty weak recording. The guitars and drums sound tinny, flat, and claustrophobic. It's hardly the range of lows and highs I'd want in order to appreciate the intricate, detailed performances laced into this album. 

Despite that unforgettable pothole, I like a good chunk of the tracks on here. I can't say I hated any, but I was left feeling like this was just another Hella record in some spots. However, I wouldn't want to hear anybody make a Hella record but Hella.

2515,Red Hot Chili Peppers- I'm With You ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QoB3sifzw

One of the longest-running acts in alternative rock has a new album out, Considering I grew up with a lotta this band's stuff on the radio, I thought I'd be a little more excited to hear the Chili Peppers have a new album out, Sadly, I wasn't, but I'm glad you guys pointed my ears in the direction of this LP via many, many requests.

Though I wasn't in love with the whole thing, I got a nice blast of nostalgia from this LP, which reminded me of what I love most about this band: Great vocals and strong grooves. Though this album sees the band dealing with a pretty notable lineup change, they make the best of it by venturing into less familiar territory.

I'm happy that old dogs are learning new tracks on this album, but not every tick has been perfected. While an acoustic guitar intro on the third track works really well, I'm at a loss with other spots on this LP that feature bossa nova sounds, a drum machine, and some narrated vocals.

This band isn't gonna take the changes they face lying down. I like that. Though I'm not in love with every track here, I like that.

2516,Giles Corey- Giles Corey ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgWMXKMiTg

Dan Barrett's latest project, a full-length album and book, is both a personal and fictional exploration of death, suicide, depression, and the afterlife. Because of that, this video takes a look at both the music and the book that comes with this package.

If anything makes the tracks on this CD stand out, it's the atmosphere. Dan Barrett has a somewhat messy production style, but like any Mount Eerie album, it lends this project an interesting sound you're not gonna hear anywhere else.

With one track after another being slathered in reverb, there are moments on here that remind me of Grizzly Bear's 2007 album Yellow House. However, there's a disturbing aura surrounding this album, which the book empowers.

Though there are some standout songs on this release, I like to take it as more of an experience--not just an assembly of tracks. Because to me, this album stirs up the same emotions any great piece of horror or science fiction would. Those emotions are filtered through a singer-songwriter lens, and it somehow works.

Connecticut rapper Apathy brings a modern feel to the classic sounds of East Coast hip hop on his latest album, Honkey Kong. Though this LP doesn't experiment or step over any major boundaries, it does come with a lot of consistency, quotable lyricism, and solid beats.

Despite a few forgettable beats and corny hooks,  the brighter spots on this LP are great enough to outshine the darker ones.

2518,Danny Brown- XXX ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/08/stream-danny-browns-xxx/

Detroit rapper Danny Brown's latest album functions in extremes. They're not really the angry, voluminous extremes the latest Death Grips album functions on. They're more like extremes of excess. Of course, what Danny is being excessive with is drugs, sex, misogyny, and basically anything else that one can have too much of.

Though it's nothing new to hear someone rapping about this stuff, Danny takes it from a darker angle. The drugs and sex on this album don't really feel all that flashy or commendable. Instead, it's shocking enough to make a listener wanna go Mormon.

The flows are hard, the beats are pretty experimental, and I'm totally down with this guy's outlandish lyricism. Loving it.

Active Child's sophomore release has some pretty haunting and beautiful sounds. Lone member Pat Grossi's choir boy falsetto is undeniably good. Plus, all the effects he laces into these tracks makes this LP an interesting listen.

While I'm not in love with every song on this LP, the sounds are stellar. In my opinion, what's best are the couple tracks where Active Child embraces the sound of experimental R&B. That's an idea I'd love to hear explored further.

Track review from May: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/05/africa-hitech-gangslap/

It took a while for Africa Hitech's debut LP to grow on me. When the album originally came out in May, I took some favorites from it, but dismissed the rest as being too hectic to be really enjoyable.

However, I found myself just itching to listen to this thing again at the beginning of this month. To my surprise, I ended up loving the album from front to back. I still think some of the sounds could have been mixed a little better, but I love the rigid and primal mix of African and electronic sounds that flow throughout this LP. This isn't your average fusion of these two worlds, believe me.

The War On Drugs' Slave Ambient is a glistening set of folk rock tunes and kinda ambient instrumentals. The production, for me, is a real blessing on this LP. The sounds are so pretty, which actually makes me wanna revisit a great deal of these tracks.

But as far as songwriting and vocal deliveries go, the nail isn't hit on the head every single time. Plus, a good chunk of these songs either feel too alike other tracks on this album. I'd even go as far as saying there's a bit of filler on here.

Still, there are more good moments than bad with Slave Ambient, which makes the War On Drugs a project worth watching closely.

On her sophomore album, Chelsea Wolfe brings together ten pieces of straight up darkness. But what makes the dreary, depressing feelings on this album so palatable is that Wolfe attacks this darkness from multiple angles with noise rock guitars, doom metal riffs, ambient soundscapes, smooth beats, and blood-curdling snarls.

While all the songs head roughly in the same direction, they find various ways to do it without adding up to an album that feels disjointed or scatterbrained.

On Rival Sons' sophomore album, the California quartet makes the classic sounds of hard rock and blues rock kind of exciting again. While these dudes are nowhere near as flashy as some of the bands that influence them, they do pull together some really great sounds on this LP.

Pressure & Time is an album that drowns in its influences a bit, though. There is a modern sound to this record, but it's not exactly like these guys are reinventing the wheel.

New York's Cerebral Ballzy have a lot of energy and rage, but I still don't know what exactly is causing all of it. It's just my opinion, but I didn't find much to get enraged over in the lyrics on this album. Being told where to pee should be the least of society's worries.

There are bellyaches aimed toward cops and authority on this album, but the fish these songs do fry are small ones. There's nothing that boldly points at things like corruption or even police brutality. The lyrics just cry out against the same restrictions a parent might put on a toddler. If Cerebral Ballzy had a rap sheet, I'd guess it would be filled mostly with counts of loitering, vandalism, and petty theft. 

Aside from the thrashy riffs and great production, I guess I don't see a lot of purpose in this record. I know that's a very personal thing, but what reviews of mine aren't simply just my personal view.

On Watch the Throne, Kanye and Jay-Z team up for a celebration I'm sure their fans are going to love. The heavyweight MCs celebrate their relevancy, fame, and popularity with one track after another--occasionally stopping to make an introspective or societal observation. While the idea of the album is great, not every song is as fantastic as the next. 

No matter which songs seem appealing on this album, there are bound to be some that pale in comparison since this album is a little scatterbrained when it comes to beat and lyrical quality. 

Kanye and Jay-Z take this thing in numerous directions, relying on their celebrity status to carry the album forward. Kanye and Jay-Z relying on their star power isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I've loved a lot of music these guys have put out in the past, but my love stops there. I'm not in love with these guys as celebs or personalities, and I think--on some level--maybe a listener has to be in order to get complete enjoyment out of this album.

For me, Beirut's new album is a small step back from the Flying Club Cup and the March of the Zapotec EP that preceded it. I was sure all this waiting would result in something bigger and better, but the ambition needed for that doesn't surface on the Rip Tide. It just seems like business as usual. Maybe this would have been acceptable as a release between Gulag and Flying, but the arrangements and foreign flavors of Beirut have held much more water on previous releases, and enhanced the Beirut experience.

This compilation features 15 cuts from a time span of several years in Nigeria's musical history. It was a time when Phonodisk, a record label looking to engineer hits, started promoting Nigerian bands playing with some sounds that were big in the West at the time: disco and funk.

Some of the tracks here are produced so well, and are a perfect recreation the formula that produced so many chart-topping hits. Others have the basic elements, but are hilariously off the mark. Honesty, I don't know who told some of these people they could sing. I'm looking at you Amel Addmore.

Though there are some sideshows and missteps, a majority of the tracks on here are pretty solid. Sometimes the foreign charm even helps the track out, which is the case for tracks like ""Big Race,"" ""Boys and Girls,"" and ""Music Alone.""

It's a fun compilation. Just don't go into it expecting every track to be gold.

Despite a bit of genre-hopping, Machinedrum's latest album, Room(s), comes together quite nicely. There are moments tracks influenced by the world of wonky hip hop instrumentals--you know, the kinda stuff Brainfeeder drops on a regular basis--which is something this guys has always had a soft spot for.

But Machinedrum is very good about appealing to the winds of change whenever possible. And now that the sounds of dubstep and future garage are hot, he's trying his hand at recreating the sounds have have made names for guys like Burial. I'm sure it's something that will get his guy called a rip-off, but these emulations are when this album sounds best, truthfully.

With Hodgy Beats on the mic and Left Brain building the beats, the tracks here offer up a series of fantasy raps about girls, weed, and guns. This is by no means an mind-blower of an album, but that's definitely made up for in simplicity and accessibility.

The beats here are a slight cut above what usually makes it onto an Odd Future-related album, and Hodgy Beats' mic skills are good, too.

Still, don't come in here expecting a mature personality ready to spit something highbrow. This album is much more primal. And part of what makes it a more refreshing release than Goblin is that it's not weighted down in internet drama and blog post bullshit. 

There are some undeniably good hip hop tracks on here. but do yourself a favor and try not to take this album too seriously. I highly doubt Hodgy Beats and Mike G play corners, and I don't think anybody in the Odd Future crew is a cop killer. As immature as this album can be, it's all for fun. Don't you remember being younger and wanting to say whatever you wanted? That's what attracted me to Bastard so much. This album walks along those lines, too, but with noticeably less consistency.

Oh, and get Left Brain to practice his mic skills, please.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

2535,Little Dragon- Ritual Union ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W6AEdc-sZQ

Little Dragon's third album comes after a move toward accessibility on 2009's machine dreams, but doesn't go further down that path. Making things simpler to gain a wider audience just seems like something a band in Little Dragons' shoes would do, though. They've had plenty of opportunities to collaborate with some pretty high-profile artists in the past year or so: Big Boi, SBTRKT, the Gorillaz.

Rather than turning up the volume, Ritual Union brings things down to a low and sensual simmer. Every track here is backed up with simple, repetitive grooves that grow as the song progresses. The synths aren't as loud or bright as they were in '09, but they still sound fantastic.

Of course, this is all topped off with frontwoman Yukumi's fantastic voice. She really lays it all out on this album, lending the music tons of personality and emotion.

It's less instant than these guys have been in the past, but revisiting this album to see it unfold was very worth it for me. This album doesn't put out, it pulls in.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

2536,They Might Be Giants- Join Us ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB1aFKnoQf0

If the rock history books stay accurate, Brooklyn's They Might Be Giants will go down as being one of the most idiosyncratic bands of all-time--even if that idiosyncrasy seems to wane a little bit on Join Us.

This record isn't completely devoid of fun or flavor. The Johns' usual buffet of strong melodies, catchy hooks, and esoteric lyrics is here. If anything on this album will keep longtime fans happy, it's that.

However, the sound here is really lacking the bold and kooky flavor I'm usually in line to be served. It sounds like something that would get plainly cited as a more mature direction. To me, it's just less. Less fun, less color, less spirit.

I wasn't offended by this album, and there's a good chunk of songs on here that are so good they make the sound of Join Us irrelevant. Still, not every track scratched that itch.

Alaska's Portugal. The Man made its Atlantic Records debut with this new album, In the Mountain In the Cloud. And because I didn't really like the band's past two albums, I'm surprised to see the music moving in a direction I like a lot more this time around.

The ambition that permeated from Portugal's earlier work is more present here. Though the band still feels it necessary to edit their songs heavily, structuring them down to the most simple of parts, the instrumentation is too big, bright, and joyous to not enjoy. Plus, the band does let go a bit on some of the songs here, allowing the music to wander indulgently and build tension.

It's not amazing me, but I'll take it.

2539,Toxic Holocaust- Conjure and Command ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/07/toxic-holocaust-nowhere-to-run/

On Toxic Holocaust's fourth album, the Portland band takes a leaner approach to its grimy fusion of punk and thrash metal, lowering the black metal influences that were once prominent on the band's earlier releases.

While there's not a lot of variety to be had on this release, it's not something I really ask for from this album. It's quick, 33-minute shot of rough riffs and tooth-gnashing ferocity.

On the Cool Kids' full-length debut, When Fish Ride Bicycles, the Chicago duo pulls together some impressive beats and features. The great beats are to be expected, but things really deteriorate in the rapping and lyricism departments.

I know it's band to simply get hung up over the lyricism of this album, but it's really holding me back on this one. I know the Kids' earlier stuff wasn't the most lyrical material on the planet, but When Fish Ride is really an album for people who don't listen much to the lyrics.

On the Horrors third LP, the primary colors that combined to created the band's eccentric brand of post-punk start to fade a little bit; however, I think the move is sort of intentional.

Rather than sticking to their guns, the band is moving in a decidedly psychedelic and atmospheric direction with many tracks on Skying. And while their aren't any terrible tracks to be heard on this release, some of the results are underwhelming, admittedly.

Still, if you've been a fan of the band up until this point, there's no reason not to visit this release, because there are definitely some leaner and brighter songs to be heard among these ten tracks.

""You and I"" Review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Eiy1V32zws

Washed Out's debut LP definitely brings a comparative change from the project's early EPs. I guess my issue is that the change just isn't enough to make me wanna stick with this album over previous efforts.

There are flashes of progression and ambition here and there, but tracks like ""Eyes Be Closed"" and ""Echoes"" seem to repeat old ideas and pump out great sounds without backing them with great songs.

So, as you can figure, I was a little underwhelmed at certain points of this album. But maybe there will be future releases from this project I'll like more. Washed out, we'll be in touch.

Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar doesn't follow the usual tough and hardened stereotypes that come with repping the California city. The guy isn't a wimp, but he's more interested in saying something thought-provoking than violent.

Backed by some fantastic beats, that's what every track on this new album, Section.80, boils down to: Food for thought. Whether the top is street violence, becoming famous, or where his generation is headed, Kendrick always has something substantial to say.

While a few tracks on here sound a little too corny for their own good, Section.80 is still a solid debut from the California kid.

Ulcerate's latest album might not hit the spot for fans of the New Zealand group's more hectic material, but it definitely resonated with me. The relentless drumming and dissonant guitar passages create an ugly atmosphere that's ever-evolving. These guys display an extreme level of technical precision on each of these seven tracks, but the music isn't so flashy that it loses me. In fact, that precision manifests itself into a ton of interplay and some sick grooves that are almost too dizzying to follow.

It's a solid metal album. I may not be completely down with how it was mixed, but the performances are absolutely stellar. Definitely a heavy treat.

On Black Up, Shabazz Palaces take hip hop deep into the left field with odd beats and surreal effects. It's definitely an indulgent LP that requires a little bit of effort from the listener, but repeating these songs until they completely unfold is worth the wait.

Part of me is sure this album is going to warrant a lot of comments like, "" I don't usually listen to hip hop, but this is great!"" But that shouldn't discourage people who listen to the genre more regularly to check it out. Though this album sounds like it came outta nowhere, the artists on it haven't. Lazaro's experience goes way back to the 90s hip hop outfit Digable Planets, but exactly which planet he's on with this album is a hard question to answer.

if you're a fan of the mutant expressions from artists such as Zeroh, Quasimoto, or Madvillain, check it out. Defintiely something the Stones Throw or Brainfeeder heads will love.

New York's Cults have a deeply rooted love for pop's older and more sentimental side. Considering how referential this music is, these two must be extremely well-verse when it comes to the Spectors, Wilsons, and Meeks of the world. I'm sure they're even fans of artists in the Twee genre some people are so willing to label them with.

The duo's style and sunny disposition is definitely the most solid thing this album has going for it--well, that's the case for some people, anyway.

For me, it's these very things that are kind of pushing me away from this album. Sure, I dig on Camera Obscura or some Pains of Being Pure at Heart, but this is too sweet for even me. 

A few of the songs here, like ""Go Outside"" and ""Oh My God,"" come off with original melodies and fleshed out song structures, but many tracks here feel too familiar for me to want to latch on. Some songs even lazily fade out after a quick couple of verses and choruses, like ""Abducted,"" leaving me wanting a lot more.

So, I'm pretty lost on this one. It's definitely sweet, but I can't say much more about it than that. Just some young and fun revivalism that flies in one ear, and quickly shoots out the other for me.

EDIT: This video was reuploaded due to some inaccuracies on my part. I apologize for the confusion. I edited the video's audio to fix the mistake.

On SBTRKT's self-titled debut, this London-based producer cooks up a solid set of dubstep songs; icing them with some pretty soulful vocals from Sampha. Plus, the clean and lean electronics bubbling under him are the perfect complement to the feelings he's conveying. There are several different vocalists featured, though, and not all of them are as much of a treat to hear--with the exception of Little Dragon, of course.

I'd recommend this highly to both Flying Lotus and James Blake fans, because there's so much worth comparing between these three artists. Not only is Sampha's voice pretty close to Blake's, but the lush layers of synthetic tones on a lot of these songs remind me of more recent tracks in Fly Lo's discography.

This is a solid debut for me. Great beats, vocals I get caught up in, and catchy hooks.

2557,Bon Iver- Bon Iver ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/06/stream-the-new-bon-iver/

On Bon Iver's Bon Iver, the project opens the floodgates and welcomes in a sea of new instrumentation. Everything from clarinet to string arrangements are laced into these songs to widen the spectrum of sounds that were once so sparse four years ago on For Emma, Forever Ago.

But just because we've got a ton of new sounds doesn't mean they've been arranged or mixed all that well.

It might be impressive to see some of these songs played life--well, it might be very impressive, actually. But the thing is the recording quality of this LP squishes so many of the climaxes here until they're a strip of roadkill on the summer asphalt. When that's not the issues, saxophones or guitars may wander around the mix aimlessly, looking for some kind of pocket to fit in. 

It's a little like watching a grade school soccer game. No one player paying attention to his or her position or duty on the field. Instead, everybody is just running for the ball at once.

Don't get me wrong, because I do think a lot of the songs on here are pretty strong. I'd probably love all of these tracks if they were recorded with as much modesty and focus as ""Wash."" or ""Towers.""

It's the sound of this album that ends up killing me most of the time, not the songs.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? what should I review next?

2559,"Bad Meets Evil- Hell: The Sequel EP REVIEW (Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"")","Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJOsjP33nF4

On bad meets Evil, Eminem and Royce Da 5'9"" bring the best out in one another and start spitting fire like King Koopa on the last stage of Super Mario Brothers.

These guys put their drama and hip hop superstar backgrounds behind them to send out verse after rap battle verse that paint them as two of the most uncaring, reckless, and misogynistic men on the planet. Or rather, Evil.

While the lyrics are vivid and the flows are unstoppable--especially on the posse track that ends this EP--there's nothing all that special or unique about these beats or hooks. The fact of the matter is the production isn't living up to how great of a tag team these two Detroit vets are.

Still, despite what issues this album has, this is a must-listen for both Royce and Em fans. Because they really do push one another to write some great verses on this one. Hopefully, we won't need to wait another decade for these guys to release another set of tracks.

What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too?

2560,Blood Ceremony- Living With the Ancients ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/06/blood-ceremony-the-great-god-pan/ 

On Blood Ceremony's second album, the Canadian band embraces a traditional style of doom metal; but they still manage to make worlds collide. With guitar riffs coming straight out of the Toni Iommi playbook and flute playing that calls out to Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, this album is like a rock nerd fantasy collaboration come true! 

Everything from the musicianship to the recording style on this album is pretty damn solid. I'm not 100% on the vocals, but it's a detail I can overlook when everything else I'm dealing with here is so rich, smoky, and flavorful. 

What did you think of this album? What should I review next? I like you!

WU LYF's debut album rides in on a tidal wave of reverb and eccentric yelps from the band's lead singer. While it does have a uniform sound and a style, I feel like the style drowns out what this band has to offer in this songs most of the time. The echoes make their instruments bounce off one another in a wild mess that's more disorienting than interesting.

I like the ingredients, but the batter tastes a little off to me, I guess.

2563,Fucked Up- David Comes to Life ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/05/fucked-up-queen-of-hearts-2/

On Fucked Up's new album, the band brings concept to the forefront for a group of songs that tell a dramatic tale of love and loss. It's pretty, well, complicated.

As ""epic"" as this story is, what makes it grandiose also kinda kills it for me, too. These songs make use of punk's trademark aggression and speed, but draws all the intensity out to a point where it no longer feels energetic, thrilling, cathartic, or any of the other things I look to this style of music for.

Which leads me to believe that it's just not for me. Maybe some of the more melodic moments could have gone over better if the vocals displayed as much dynamics, but the recording, instrumentation, and message are all pretty good.

For any punk fan, love it or hate it, it's at least worth a visit.

Considering this album's lineup change, its group of new guest singers, Gloss Drop must have been a bit of a challenge for Battles. Also, don't forget to add the fact this thing is the band's Sophomore LP, which comes after a highly praised first album.

If this was a test, Battles passed with flying pink colors. The instrumentation, musicianship, and grooves throughout this album are intense as hell. And guest vocalists like Matias Aguayo and Yamantaka Eye freaking kill it!

http://theneedledrop.com/2011/05/snake-oil-can-of-love-and-the-captain/

Snake Oil's debut LP is a pretty nice piece of instrumental psych rock. The recording of this this is really great, too. It separates the instrumentation perfectly, and swells very nicely when everything layers on top of one another.

The melodies are decent, and the grooves are nice, but some of these tracks come off a little flat in the interplay department. At times, it can feel like the drums and everything else are in two completely different worlds. While the skins do their best to throw in fills and build up to certain moments, the guitars and keys tend to carry on like they're the only thing that matters in the mix, which only leads to them missing out on possible moments of syncopation. 

There are a couple tracks that strike me as filler, but Snake Oil still pulled together a solid direction on their self-titled debut, and they're off to a great start with these 9 tracks. 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Whyyyyy? What should I review next, too?

2567,Arctic Monkeys- Suck It and See ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/04/arctic-monkeys-dont-sit-down-cause-ive-moved-your-chair/

On Arctic Monkeys' latest album, the band drains themselves of adrenaline to play a set of songs that go back in time and try to revive a group of dated sounds. The guys play with sunshine pop, garage rock, and even some Queens of the Stone Age-esque riffage make it into the mix.

But the problem is, the band's spin on these old school sounds isn't that interesting. For a fan, it may be interesting to see the group do something different, but as someone who isn't a diehard for this group, hearing the 'Monkeys do this isn't any more thrilling than hearing any other group do it.

There are a few tracks here that standout from a songwriting standpoint, but much of this record is about hearing the band play with a bunch of sounds they love, not develop something with a distinct style or personality.

Still, it's better than Beady Eye, I guess.

On its latest release, Woods make their sound a little sunnier with brighter guitar leads and attitudes. But some of the songs here just feel too unfinished to really feel memorable or exciting for me. I dig this band a lot, but I almost feel like I've fallen off the wagon on this one.

Their past several records, in my opinion, have been fantastic. This feels like it lives in the shadow of Woods' previous material because of its underwhelming execution, half-baked songs, and melodies that are eerily similar to that of past material from this band.

Plus, what's possibly the most enjoyable track here is a cover song.

I'm not on board with this album, sadly, but these guys seem to drop something new about every year. Maybe I'll like the next release more.

2569,Planningtorock- W ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWO9LweKzV8

What can I say about Planningtorock's latest album that's positive? Honestly, not much. Not only that, but I'm awestruck at how positive some of the receptions have been to what she's doing. I don't begrudge her the fanbase she's gathered so far--especially since her first album was pretty good--but hearing the majority opinion differ so much from what I feel personally makes me question my own sanity, honestly.

But on her latest album, Planningtorock makes about every move possible to use terrible vocal effects, construct flat and repetitive songs, and flaunt weak melodies like they're something to behold.

The lyrics are pretty lacking as well. I'm still not sure what significance being on fire holds for this album, but it sure seems like a central theme on some of these songs. The problem is most of the time I feel like Planningtorock is just writing lyrics to have them, or to have something to sing in her vocal parts.

Between the effects, songwriting, singing, and lyrics, I couldn't find one moment I loved about this album. There are spots that are relatively better than others, but I was bored or offended on most of these tracks.

What makes it worse is there's a stench that surrounds this album that smells a lot like the Knife for Fever ray. Honestly, I've got not problems with showing off your influences, but at least do them justice.

I've said in prior reviews, you're probably not making interesting art if you're not offending somebody. Maybe this is objectively ""good"" music, and I just happen to be that one guy it offends.

OK, so it's widely acknowledged that a lot of people don't care about Death Cab for cutie anymore. I guess I used to be one of them, too.

But because of all the requests and my own curiosity, I figured I'd try out Codes and Keys since it's been a while since I tried to get into this band's recent output.

While I wasn't blown away, I was pleasantly surprised to see Gibbard and the gang still ""have it."" Their songwriting is leaner and catchier than ever. Maybe the songs aren't as emotionally torn as the band's early work, but I have to admit I was enjoying the positive vibes that this album was giving off. There are so many feel-good moments on here between ""You are a Tourist"" and ""Underneath the Sycamore.""

While many groups have taken the ""indie"" sound and tried growing it into something flashier, Death Cab is keeping things earnest and honest. If you're looking for some down-to-earth pop music, there's no reason not to visit with this album.

Sure, Death Cab is far past the point in their career where they're mostly break new ground or something like that. But this isn't exactly what this album is shooting for anyway. This LP appeals to a part of me that positively reviewed that Cake record earlier this year, too. Sometimes, it's nice to take it easy, lay back, and just enjoy something doesn't doesn't require reading into the lyrics or pulling apart every minor subtlety.

With strong drums and Ben's signature vocals, this is something nice to coast on this summer.

Theophilus London's new EP, Lover's Holiday, is a piece of pop rap I can really get down with. Not only are some strong new wave influences tastefully shown on off this thing, but the songwriting is crafted for maximum enjoyability.

With strong melodies, beats, and guest singers, Theo has set a serious bar for himself when his next full-length drops later this year. Outperforming singles like ""Flying Overseas"" is going to be a tough thing to do.

Overall, these songs are rich with hooks, melody, and personality. I kind of get the feeling the this guy might be bordering on being a little too ""cool"" for my ears, but it's nothing I can't handle.

My Morning Jacket's latest album was a two-part surprise for me. First, I was happy to hear how alive and ambitious the first half of this album was. Not only are the hooks and instrumentation strong, but the band seems equally comfortable saying something beautiful or funny with their lyrics.

But the second shocker was when the latter half of this record pulled the rug out from under me with some pretty underwhelming songwriting and vocal deliveries. While it's nice to have some familiar reference points on this album--which show up in some tried and true chord progressions and melodies--My Morning Jacket doesn't exactly refurbish these ideas in a very exciting way. 

I am literally split on this album. Some points really seduce me, but others make me feel like the steam just ran out halfway through. Dang!

When it comes to choosing a direction, Seattle's Master Musicians of Bukkake have a little bit of musical ADD. That's fine, though. Most of the time--no matter what style these seven guys happen to be embracing--they always put a ton of heart and creativity into what they're doing. 

Some tracks on this third installment in the Totem series create dark soundscapes, and others feel like seeing a rebel group of desert guitarists play the kind of heavy psych rock bands like Tinariwen are known for popularizing.

While I don't mind this album being all over the place, there are some experiments here that don't impact me as much as others. It's pretty solid, and worth a visit for any experimental music fanatic. Go on an adventure, seriously.

On Coma Cinema's third album lo-fi production backs up some real-life sadness on about 15 songs. It's a little spotty, but nothing really sticks around long enough to disappoint. Some songs here really did hit me as memorable on my first listen, though.

2578,Elzhi- Elmatic ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Mtwi8MzEE

Download: http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/05/download-elzhis-elmatic-now/

This YouTube channel review'd the tape, too: http://youtube.com/deadendhiphop

On Elmatic, Detroit's Elzhi rewrite's Nas' seminal Illmatic to fit his personal story. Thanks to his flow, lyricism, and some production help from the Will Sessions band, the project goes off without a hitch. 

I'm sure it'll be debated whether or not this album is better than the original. And, of course, Illmatic will reign supreme. I'm not here to put my two cents in on that one, though.

What I will say is from the perspective of a tribute, revitalization, or revamp, this thing is freaking fantastic. Hell, it's more enjoyable than a lot of original albums I come across. It's just a nice reminder of hip hop's best characteristics, and what a trip it's been since the '94 release of the original.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? What should I review next?

2581,This Will Destroy You- Tunnel Blanket ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fV9mXWMDqs

This Will Destroy You's latest LP starts and finished with flying colors, but it gets a little underwhelming in the middle for me. Hearing the band revisit old sounds, work with an odd drum mix, and working with similar structures throughout this album make me rethink my original love for some of the tracks here. In terms of structure, I'm really not wowed by this album.

Where I am incredibly impressed is with the textures here! The sounds are fantastic, and some of the best I've heard this year. They're kind of a saving grace for this album. The guitars sound amazing, and the swells here are so subtle. Sure, this could be labeled as ""post-rock"" at some points, but This Will Destroy You are working with tools that just seem out of this world as several points on this album.

I'm kinda warm toward it, I suppose. I can't see myself returning to this anytime soon, though.

2582,The UV Race- Homo ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/04/the-uv-race-girl-in-my-head/

On their sophomore album, Australia's the UV Race brings garage rock to a dirtier and grimier level than most. The band's loose song structures and loose playing bring a lot of, well, ""character"" to these recordings. There are flubbed notes everywhere, and it's all for the sake of sounding noisier.

Chaos within limits is the name of the game on Homo, and I'll be dammed if these guys didn't make sounding messy feel fun as hell!

There's an obvious Velvet Underground influence flowing throughout this. A lot of these tracks feel like abridged versions of the song ""Sister Ray,"" but there's also a lot of love if you're more of a fan of the Fall or the Stooges.

It's a raw, loud mess, but I'm too busy dancing to clean it up.

2583,Amon Tobin- ISAM ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/04/stream-the-new-amon-tobin/

On hit latest release, Amon Tobin isn't building songs as much as he is sounds. The textures on most of this album are absolutely amazing, and among the best this Brazilian electronica producer has ever created.

I love how abstract, adventurous, and mind-bending the first two thirds of this album can be, but the mood takes an odd turn toward the finish line.

Tracks like ""Kitty Cat"" and ""Bedroom Stories"" represent a lighter, cuter side to this release that doesn't necessarily agree with me. Not only did I not see the album going in this direction, but it's not necessarily a place I wanted to go.

There is a creepy, eerie momentum to the last third of this LP, but it definitely doesn't measure up to my love of the massive sounds located at the start of ISAM.

Still, the last portion of this album isn't terrible. Maybe it just seems out of place. Tobin does make efforts to guide one section of this album into the other with some lighter interludes in the middle of this LP, but the final songs here are still kinda lost on me.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

2586,Manchester Orchestra- Simple Math ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkkeHpzs0lI

On the band's latest album, Manchester Orchestra seems to lose of a lot of the passion and rock 'n' roll momentum that have made their last two LPs pretty decent. They've exchanged this for some relatively heavier production and string arrangements. In my opinion, it wasn't that great of a trade.

Though all of these arrangements lend Simple Math a finer, more dynamic feel, many of the songs here feel drowned out in their wish to cloak themselves in different sounds. Sometimes that sound is a booming guitar, and sometimes it's a horn.

It's nice to hear these guys incorporating more textures into their repertoire on this LP, but it's at the sacrifice of some decent indie rock songwriting. ""Deer"" and ""Pensacola"" come off as two of the most earnest songs here. Much of what I'm listening to here feels too overblown for me to really enjoy thoroughly.

But, that's just my opinion.

2587,Liturgy- Aesthethica ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4743

Do intentions matter: A reaction to transcendental black metal? http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4847

On Liturgy's latest album, the interplay and musicianship that made 2009's Renihilation so memorable are magnified with tons of syncopation and detail.

Another great addition to this band's style is their use of swells and crescendos, and it's not in the cliche post-rock way that we're all so used to. This band's dynamics are a result of musicianship and performing as a cohesive unit, not a ton of sound effects throw in during post-production.

Outside of that, the chord progressions of this album are rich and melodic. It's a sweet counterpoint to all of the harsh vocals, guitar chords, and crash cymbals. The moments where tremolo-picked guitars are layered on top of each other only enhance the effect.

There are a few underwhelming moments, and a couple detours, but the album is pretty dang solid! I'm loving the sound, the style, and the songs.

2588,The Lonely Island- Turtleneck and Chain ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o

Turtleneck and Chain has some pretty memorable tacks on it, to be honest. Some of these might be the best this comedy rap outfit has ever penned. ""I Just Had Sex"" has already blown most of their other videos away on the view count, and the title track is a hilarious piece of wardrobe humor I've never really heard them dive into before.

The features here are pretty nice. I heard everybody from Beck to MIchael Bolton on here. I guess my only problem is some of these tracks aren't that funny to me at all. Some even fail to reach a level of ridiculousness some of the other tracks do. I'd figure with a song like ""I Just Had Sex"" on there, songs like ""The Creep"" would have some kind of bar to reach for when it came to jokes and gags. 

Plus, it sort of bugs me that this music sounds exactly like the style of pop rap it's trying to create a slight parody of. I guess you should keep your enemies close, but we're so close it's hard to tell what the relationship Lonely Island has with this music really is. Maybe they're ""frenemies""?

Either way, tracks like ""Jack Sparrow"" and ""Throw It On the Ground"" are refreshingly absurd, letting go of any perceived need to make sense. That, to me, is where I really get something out of this album. The dick jokes are alright, too.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? What do you think of comedy in music? What is the funniest song you've ever heard? Is it ""Pizza Party"" by L'Homme Run? Is it ""Like  Surgeon by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic?

Wild Beast's Smother shows the band toning things down, and making a sound that comes off eerier than the material on their previous two albums. Though this LP still holds some of the grooves their last albums did, the songs here carry a much more serious tone--maybe too serious?

There are some great tunes and passionate vocals here, but a good chunk of these tracks come off as being merely agreeable--you know, not offending or enthralling.

I'll be listening for this band's next release, because I am intrigued by what their next move will be, but I'm still stopping just short of loving this LP.

1. New video from Snake Oil: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4599
2. Stream a new Zombi track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4619

On their latest album, the Antlers work to improve the lo-fi recording quality they were dealing with on their last album, and they definitely succeed in that department. The instruments and the mix sound absolutely fantastic.

But there are more changes. First off, the storytelling that made their past LP so seductive to many has kind of left the building this time. There are tales told in these songs, but this unorganized collection of ten tracks feels like exactly that.

Still, there are a couple flickers of great songwriting here, and the new direction these guys are going in have made things much more accessible. However, there's this nondescript feeling I can't shake from this album. So much of it feels underwhelming or forgettable to me. The oddest moments are those that sound like they could have come out of a Radiohead tune--which only reminds me how flat the drama really is here.

But that's just me. If you're digging that album, keep on digging it. I'm lost on this one, I guess.

2593,Fleet Foxes- Helplessness Blues ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://soundcloud.com/subpop/fleet-foxes-helplessness-blues

On Helplessness Blues, Fleet Foxes improve just about everything that they were doing on their last album. Keep in mind the key word here is ""improve,"" not change. Yes, the band is still walking down the same path they were on their previous LP, but they're much further down the road, and they've got a different story to tell.

The songs on this album are extremely romantic, and not just in the sense that two lovers are romantic with one another. This album is unbelievably in love with everything around it. It finds great beauty in the world at large, and it's led to captivating melodies and poetic lyrics that tip a hat to songwriting greats like Paul Simon.

The instrumentation could come off kind of busy and overbearing for a first-time listener, but the water's feels fine after the initial shock. This thing is beautifully produced from my point of view. More detail gets pulled out of of this thing with each listen--lyrically and sonically. 

This is one that I'll be visiting again and again throughout the year.

2. New Ganglians track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4439

On their latest album, Explosions In the Sky gives the appearance of evolution with some added instrumentation: acoustic guitar, strings, hums, looped percussion, and other miscellaneous noises. However, the band hasn't really altered their playing style or sonic qualities that much. The mood has changed a little, but this is still the same band that brought All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone.

For some, that could be a great thing. Personally, it's left me really underwhelmed. Not only did I assume--a bad thing on my part, I admit--there would be some great change coming in the four years between this release and their last, but I'm not really a fan of many of the new sounds this record brings to the table. I'm enjoying some spots in the gargantuan post-rock anthems, but I'm struggling with hear an entire track without becoming bored or disengaged.

I'll just have to look forward to what these guys do in the future.

On their latest album, the Beastie Boys still sound like they're at the top of their game--which is fantastic considering their age. There's a kinetic energy between the three of them that's difficult to explain. I know these guys aren't for everybody, but there's something about their collective enthusiasm that's charmed me into loving their music. 

The rhymes here aren't anything out of the ordinary for the band. This LP is loaded with jokes, obscure references, non-sequiturs, and cunning wordplay. It doesn't have the storytelling I usually love in my hip hop, but this LP is more about living in the moment than it is chewing things over.

But the absolute cherry on top of this album is the production. It's thick, heavy, textured, noisy, psychedelic, and fantastic. It's absolutely exciting to hear the Beasties advancing their sound this late in their career. It's like they took the electronic hip hop fusions on Hello Nasty and turned them into an unstoppable monster, which is now destroying the city.

Needless to say, I've enjoyed the hell out of this album.

On their latest album CunninLyngusits bring some seriously cinematic production. All of the atmospheric textures make the perfect setting for lyrical themes dealing with dreams. 

Of course, ""dreaming"" isn't limited to what you see in your sleep. This LP delves into fantasies of all shapes and sizes: sexual, violent, ambitious. 

As interesting as it is to see Cunnin' take on this topic, I do have to admit that this type of rap music is not for the cynical. I personally don't perceive it to be cheesy, but I could see it reading that way with some people.

Still, the beats alone make it worth a visit, at the very least.

2. Stream the new Amon Tobin: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4302

The overarching theme on Apocalypse seems clear, but the chapters in this story are kind of vague, making it difficult for me to really get into this album. 

As usual, the instrumentation behind Callahan's deadpan vocals is simple and honest. It serves mostly as a stage for his poetic musings about Drovers, a self-sunk boat, a marriage gone sour, and American values.

Though I wouldn't say anything on this LP is offensively bad, it's definitely not my favorite Callahan album. Enjoyed a few tracks, but not much more.

Every time a Kills album comes on, I feel a bunch of involuntary reflexes coming on: my eyes squint, my lips tighten, and my shoulders start to shrug. I'm just unsure of why this music should appeal to me. I could certainly see myself latching onto the noisy distortion, stuttering guitar effects, and garage rock style this LP has to offer. But at the end of the day, I keep turning away because of the moody icing this album is slathered in. That and the songwriting doesn't blow my mind, I guess. Maybe I'll never be a Kills fan.

Tune-Yards' sophomore LP, for some, will be a true exercise in patience. Merrill Garbus' vocals can be a serious strain on the ears, and the amount of instrumentation she's packed into this album borders on migraine-inducing. But all of this album's quirks can easily become strengths on the right set of ears.

My favoritism varies from track to track, but this is an unmistakeably bold album. I'm not trying to say this thing forges new ground or reinvents certain sounds or styles. Not the case. In fact, this album pulls a little bit too much from African music and the Dirty Projectors to be a piece of originality.

This album's bold attitude comes from the fact it just doesn't care what you think. W H O K I L L wanders through a jungle of its own creation, and follows its nose to bowl after bowl of Fruit Loops drowning in gallons of purple Kool-Aid. 

Some tracks feature more eccentricities than music, but that's what makes this thing such a marker. Love it or hate it, you'll at least remember it.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Wormrot's brand of grindcore will probably strike most people as being old school. Their dedication to thrash metal riffs and a natural-sounding production style calls back to the genre's salad days in the 80s.

But not everything here is from the past. The band's intensity and speedy drums and guitar definitely feel 2011.

To me, this album is a reminder that musical movements can miss great things if everyone is in a rush to follow a trend or new extreme. Going back and putting a modern twist on an old sound can have great results.

In short, THIS IS BR00TAL! OMG!!!!!

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Hate gindcore in general? What should I review next?

2602,Rotten Sound- Cursed ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4168

Rotten Sound's Curse is a loud record. No one can deny that. They have the speedy blast beats, vocals, and guitar riffs every grindcore band should have. However, this LP loses a lot of potential energy in its extremely regulated recording. I know the in-the-moment sound bands like Terrorizer and Napalm Death had is a thing of the past, but even Pig Destroyer is a lot less scheduled than this band. 

The high-gloss finish on this production and the impressive musicianship will make this album entertaining for a lot of people, which is fine. That's just not what I look for in my grindcore, that's all. I'm looking for a group of guys to show me their energy as group, not a studio project.

2603,Foo Fighters- Wasting Light ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebJ2brErERQ

1. My Morning Jacket track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4150
2. Indian track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4104

Wasting Light is easily one of Foo Fighters' most consistent effort in their past several albums, but it's not resonating with me like I wanted it to. Chalk it up to the album just not being my style, I suppose.

Still, I can appreciate a great studio sound when I hear one. The guitars here are thick and gratifying in a way that reminds me of some great Queens of the Stone Age tunes. Some of the harder tracks here--like ""White Limo"" remind me of moments from the Foos' first album!

Still, there's a bit of an arena rock flavor on this LP that seems a little out of character. It's not bad, but not exactly a return to form either. I'd be alright with it if it weren't for the relentlessly generic lyricism. I understand the topics music touches on can be a little cliche, but layering that with phrases like ""you and what army"" and ""it's alright"" only make things worse--not to mention it subtracts some authenticity points.

Overall, it's not a bad album. I enjoyed it while it was on, but don't expect to find gold if you're digging for a deeper meaning here. Only a few tracks are good for that. This thing is more appropriate for a loud and heavy rock out session on top of the couch with your favorite bandana and air guitar, for sure.

2. http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4072

On their third LP, Metronomy lowers their eccentric characteristics to a simmer and gives their songwriting strenghts a workout. The track list hits with one great tune after another. And even though the sounds behind these tracks might not be fantastic, the hooks and melodies are too good not to enjoy.

An enjoyable LP of light, airy dance tunes about love and a lackthereof. For some, it's just what the doctor ordered.

1. Arctic Monkeys TRKRVW: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3971
2. Zeroh MP3s: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3953

On their latest album, Crystal Stilts brings what made their full-length debut great while still adding some extra sounds to the mix.

The tunes here are much more upbeat, and there are a few legit hits that sneak their way into the track list like ""Shake the Shackles"" and ""Through the Floor.""

In addition to that, piano and organ show up a lot more, too. They actually grab more attention than the guitar a many of these tracks, creating a lazily smashed back beat that reminds me of the Velvet Underground's ""Sister Ray""--which isn't a bad tune to share similarities with, honestly.

The lyrics bring up a lot of surrealist imagery, and the invasive reverb only intensifies the dreamy soundscape.

Though Crystal Stilts wear their influences pretty proudly, there's something about them that keeps me from listening to the influences instead. There's spooky and ominous delivery to their music that just hypnotizes me into pressing the play button again and again. 

What do you think of this album? Do you be lovin' it? Do you be hatin' it? Why? Why all the hate? What do you think I should review next, eh?

1. Matthewdavid Vid:
http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3928
2. LCD Soundsystem covers Franz Ferdinand:
http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3923

After numerous revisits, this Weeknd album just isn't sitting well with me. Though I'm all for any efforts the artists of today make to change the R&B landscape, the lyricism on this LP sticks up like an unwelcome weed.

Imagine this album as an indie film, and you've been given a free ticket. Considering the fact you paid no money, the picture quality, sets, costumes, and camerawork are all quite good. Loos pretty hi-production! Maybe it'll be promising. 

But then the lead actor walks into frame, and it becomes painfully clear things are going downhill. His mannerisms are awkward, his phrasing is generic, and he wasn't given the best of lines. 

He's kind of like a younger, more risk-taking version of Johnny in Tommy Wiseau's the Room. He's nobody to sympathize with. His emotions are legitimate--even if they are a little overly dramatic--but he lacks the ability to express himself in a remotely captivating way. 

I usually do my best to avoid people like this, not listen to them sing about their self-created ""problems.""

1. Natural Child MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3815

On their latest LP bring a lotta tunes with little cohesion. There's a kinda shaky love song theme linking some of these tracks together, but it doesn't stop tracks like ""No Future Shock"" from jumping in out of nowhere. 

I enjoy quite a few of the tracks here, but for very separate reasons. ""Killer Crane"" has a fantastically blissful aura surrounding it; ""Caffeinated Consciousness"" is an in-your-face piece of funk rock that makes no apologies; and ""Second Song"" captures an emotional overload perfectly in the lyrics.

Though the instrumentation, production, words all have their strong points, there are only several moments where they all align as one to create something fantastic and memorable. ""Will Do"" is a shining example. 

A lot of these tracks are great as on a single basis, but don't really impress me that much as a procession of tracks.

1. French Horn Rebellion MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3749
2. Seekae MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3744

Timber Timbre's latest album is a scarily obsessive look at one man's post-relationship trauma. The infatuation in the lyrics here runs deep, and it's tempting to hear the record from beginning to end just to see how bad the train wreck gets.

Not that lyrics and some mild psychosis are all this album has going for it. There are plenty of fantastic arrangements, which were created with the aid of Mathieu Charbonneau. Colin Stetson lays some great horn parts down, and Mark Lawson helped take the Timber's production up another level.

The music--outside of the instrumentals--lives in a world were doo wop and rockabilly reign supreme. And it puts an innocent backdrop behind the insane musings of this character painted in the words.

It's a shadowy standout in the world of lovesick albums.

2609,The Vaccines- What Did You Expect From the Vaccines? ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU9hrd35Dsg

The Vaccines don't have the most original of styles or tunes, but they know a catchy hook when they hear one. What Did You Expect From the Vaccines? is a record that functions on those basic principles of a catchy rock album: energy, straightforwardness, volume.

With influences ranging from the Ramones to the Jesus & Mary Chain, there's definitely some ear-shattering guitar reverb on a few of these tracks, but the Vaccines rely on simplicity more than they do guts. A few tracks do stand out a being exceptionally rowdy, but there are plenty of moments where this album lowers the heat to a simmer. To me, the slower moments aren't as captivating as the fast, but it's nice the band added more than one dimension to the songs here.

While I don't think originality is the most important of things--especially since everything is influenced by something--I find it difficult finding something to take away from this album. There a handful of fun tracks; and while the others aren't bad at all, they're nothing to flip out over, for me.

I enjoyed it, but I'm in no rush to come back, that's all. Just my opinion.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Is it a 'rip off'? What isn't a 'rip off' of something else in some way, shape,  or form? Is originality all that important?

Holy Ghost!'s debut LP is buff with great sounds, songs, and production value. This is not some soggy, lo-fi set of dance tracks you'd find for free on the internet somewhere. This is a crisp, lush barrage of beats and hooks.

This LP is on DFA Records, and Holy Ghost! is currently holding the torch when it comes to the label's reputation for great alternative dance music.

A lotta the hooks and melodies here stuck with me instantly, but the game this band plays has been played before--but arguably, no one is yet to play it this well in 2011. 

While I've heard this style before, it hasn't stopped me from enjoying this at all. If there's a great song behind the aesthetic, there's no reason to get hung up.

2611,Panda Bear- Tomboy ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPzNq03e7e8

I enjoy Animal Collective as much as the next guy, which is why I'm baffled by this album failing to translate in any sort of major enjoyment to me.

I have to admit I kind of saw this coming, though. Many of these tracks were released on singles before the album release, and I only enjoyed a few of them. However, I have to admit that the sonice qualities of these tracks really do come together into a cohesive direction on the LP. Everything works together as one. The album is basically Voltron, and the singles were merely automatons waiting to be assembled into a psych pop war machine.

Though the direction and style this album embraces is pretty clear, I can't say I'm a fan of it. The disruptive, glossy delay that's covering nearly everything on these songs doesn't make them all that appealing. For me, it actually has the opposite effect. Panda Bear writes some really captivating melodies on ""Surfer's Hymn"" and ""Last Night at the Jetty,"" but the cut and paste percussion, cacophonous mixing, and muddy guitar sounds hardly serve as the perfect foundation to make these songs shine. The atmosphere on Person Pitch was so much less disruptive, which really let the songs shine. This album obviously puts a stronger emphasis on effects and volume, but neither are doing much for me. 

The hazy wall of sound Panda Bear builds again and again on these tracks does put me into a mesmirized state of mind a few times--namely ""Afterburner"" and ""Alsation Darn."" But for me, the high is pretty mild.

I give Panda Bear a lot of respect for doing what he does in Animal Collective and in a solo capacity. I'll always check out whatever new joint he's pushing. This one just didn't do a lot for me, that's all. Respect.

What do you think of this LP? Is it lackluster? Is it amazing? Why? How do you think this compares with Person Pitch?

1. Blake Mills Review: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3441
2. Fleet Foxes Vid: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3422

Trap Them's third album won't be a shock if you've heard their earlier work, but they have inched once more toward a unified sound. 

With Kurt Ballou at the controls again, the band has built a torturous gauntlet of twelve pounding tracks. They've got the intensity of Converge, plenty of d-beat rhythms, and a buzzsaw guitar tone that recalls early Entombed. 

The band really does have a lot going for them. They might drown in their influences a bit, but they're carving a pretty nice niche for themselves in a pretty established sound. The stronger songwriting this time around is partially to blame. Not only has this band gotten a bit louder, but they're a lot more memorable, too. Though I wasn't in love with the whole album, ""the Facts"" will still be stuck in my head come December.

If you're into metal and loud rock, it's worth a visit.

2. New Fucked Up MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3367

Though it is fun to see Bibio cover so much ground on this album--jumping from cowbell rock ballads to odd electronics without batting an eye--the songs behind the sounds aren't doing all that much for me.

Not that this album isn't tuneful. In many respects it is. ""Light Sleep"" and ""Take Off Your Shirt"" are two examples. My issue is that the songs don't stand out that much to me. Bibio's abilities as a sonic chameleon are really what steal the show. But will only keep me entertained for so many listens.

It was a thrill at first, but this thing turned kinda gray kinda fast for me, sadly. Still, a track like ""Excuses"" is proof this guy can thrill me under the proper conditions. 

I don't hate the album. I'm just kind of on the fence with it, sadly. Maybe Bibio's future output will do more for me. 

But what do you think of this LP? Should I have liked it more? Do you like it more than me? Why? Do you like it less than me? Why? How do you think it compares to Bibio's previous work? What should I review next?

1. Mono/Poly track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3331
2. Big K.R.I.T. Vid: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3328

It seemed impossible, but the Pains of Being Pure at Heart have somehow found a way to sound sweeter and more innocent than they did on their self-titled debut. This slight change in direction didn't sit well with me on first listen, though. I was a little disappointed to see the noisier, more experimental elements of their music sort of melt away here; however, the band is definitely moving in a definitive direction.

This is the sound of the Pains coming into their own. Just like Beach House did with their latest album, the band is building on their initial sound with some panoramic production and more accessible sounds.

The songwriting is still strong and catchy. The vocals are still thin and breathy. The guitars still strum on a beat that's worth swaying to. Sonic innocence.

On their latest LP, the Strokes want to head in a new direction, but they can't decide on one. So they use every track to obtain a different sound. Moments like ""Under Cover of Darkness"" embrace what's best about the band's past work, but ""Two Kinds of Happiness"" shoots for a sound most would probably associate with the 80s.

Though it's kinda all over the place, most of the songs here are quite good. Maybe the band is exploring new territory since this is the first album after their hiatus.

As long as they're writing good tunes, I'll be listening.

1. Colin Stetson Take Away Show: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK90kN871p8
2. Come to this SXSW panel: http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_MP6616

As much as it pains me to say this, there's not much about this new Raekwon album that excites me. The beats attempt to copy the trademark RZA sound, the rhymes are decent at best, and the features are simply alright, too.

It's pretty obvious that this release makes little to no attempt to push itself past anything Raekwon did on his previous album, which is sad since Cuban Linx II was a pretty ambitious release. 

I'm sure Raekwon hasn't lost his footing or his ear for a good track. This thing seems like a mere transition between Cuban Linx II and Rae's next big project. It could be Linx III--he does hype it in the lyrics, after all--or something else. Who knows? I'm sure brighter days are ahead either way.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next? Who is your favorite member of the Wu-Tang Clan?

2622,"Tim Hecker- Ravedeath, 1972 ALBUM REVIEW","Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w_s_r-yttY

Tim Hecker's latest album is a barren wasteland of forgotten sounds. It's music you can truly wander through. 

Some tracks do feel a little short of breath, sadly, but there are many more standouts here than there are duds.

It's another strong piece of material in the Hecker canon. It may be difficult to separate this from his other work--simply because he shifts his sound very subtly from album to album--but it should be expected than LP of this nature would take a little extra attention when it comes to understanding it.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

2. Awesome rap: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3137

Weedeater's new LP is a heavy piece of work. This album's got a lot of rumble to it, but I'd say the sound here grinds your ear drums more than it shake's 'em. The filthy distortion and Dave Collins' trademark vocals make a great combo on this thing, creating some of the best sludge metal I've heard in a while.

The problem is the LP is weighed down by a bit of filler tho. There are moments I'm just not interested in here, sadly. However, the heavier tracks this album has to offer are still making this thing worth a listen.

1. Papercuts review: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3099
2. Four Tet stream: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3095

Though it may not be one of the Goat's most ambitious albums, the sounds and stories on All Eternals Deck are earnest and well-written. The lyrics are a potpourri of concepts, ranging from age acceptance to an all-out vampire attack.

In some says, this album is built on the same kind of song and story dynamic that have powered past albums, but there are some new sounds here, too. For example, the harmonized background vocals on ""High Hawk Season."" String arrangements have always found their way onto more recent albums, too, and that's no different here. But there's definitely some new-found ambition in utilizing them on ""Age of Kings"" and ""Outer Scorpion Squadron.""

All in all, it's a strong set of tracks that could entertain both fans and newbies. Darnielle isn't the open book he's been on albums like Sunset Tree and World to Come, but he's back at doing what he does best: Singing the stories of others.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too? What's your favorite Mountain Goats album?

1. TV On the Radio TRKRVW: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3065

Siriusmo's debut LP is a bipolar exploration through the German electronica producer's psyche. Not to say that he's crazy, but his music is a little all over the place.

This is because Siriusmo has absolutely no interest in appealing to one particular type of electronic music fan. This album is littered with club bangers, dubstep bass, odd samples, and subtle flourishes of syths. 

Though Siriusmo proves he's comfortable just about everywhere, not every song feels as finished as the next. Some cut and run before they really get to leave an impression, sadly. However, if you love variety, this will keep you coming back, I'm sure.

Yuck's latest album is a fun embrace of the sound on classic albums from Dinosaur Jr., Yo La Tengo, Elliott Smith, and many more artists and bands considered ""90s.""

While this album is an alright place to visit, it's hard to exactly describe where you are. That's because Yuck doesn't have anything going for them that you could draw specifically to them.

On Fashawn's latest mixtape, the Fresno rapper sounds as hungry as ever. He sounds fucking alive. He doesn't come off fake either. 

There's over an hour of material, and some of it seems a little half-baked--and I'm not talking about the weed references. But it's a FREE freakin' album. Though it may not be the most consistent thing in the world, listen in and pull some favorite tracks off of it. The tracks here I love, I REALLY freakin' love. 

The score is basically a reflection of how much I found myself skipping around, really. I'm excited for Fashawn's future in rap, and I think he's gonna release a fantastic new LP soon. I'm banking on it.

1. Ayatollah: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3003
2. Young Circles: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2974

PJ Harvey's latest album is easily one of her most accessible and cohesive. The lyrics are loaded with political ammunition, dealing with every from war to England as an institution. Imagery of soldiers and deformed children make it a pretty dark listen, and the production only enhances the experience.

From beginning to end, the sparse drums and watery guitars make the songs stand out. For the most part, the instrumentation is pretty simple, but it's a nice surprise when a horn, some strings, or backup vocals show up to play. 

All in all, I think it's one of her most accessible moments yet. Strong songs, creative production, and a distinct personality. Loving it.

Toro Y Moi's latest LP is a noticeable improvement compared to the sketchbook of ideas that made up his last album, Causers of this. Underneath the Pine is loaded with light, pretty arrangements and dancey disco beats. The songwriting and vocals aren't always standout, though.

While the whole album may not feel standout, it's a nice and easygoing experience, for sure. Great for soundtracking a small get together or an all-night sexcapade.

Colin Stetson's latest album redefines the saxophone in an avant-garde context. His drones, motifs, and highly technical sax runs are undeniably gripping and beautiful. Not every piece here may sound completely fleshed out, but the technical ability shown throughout the album is more than enough to distract from that extremely minor problem.

My Brightest Diamond and Laurie Anderson even show up for vocal duty on a good chunk of this album, too; bringing a new depth to the experimental nature of this album.

I guess I have to warn y'all, though. This album is music that's meant to be observed. It's nothing to party to, that's for sure. But while it may not be upbeat or ""catchy,"" it's still a really unique experience--even in light of jazz titans like Roland Kirk and Ornette Coleman.

2632,Radiohead- The King of Limbs ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A9bMTh9rdQ

Radiohead's latest LP is a fan-pleasing piece of work. It's loaded with beautiful and well-recorded sounds, and even Thom Yorke's songwriting shows some muscle with moments like ""Lotus Flower"" and ""Separator."" 

But there's something that clicks away and eats away at the first half of this album, in my opinion. Though I like what I'm hearing, I can't say I'm enjoying how it's organized. It kinda sounds like the beat arrangements were produced on a ""ctrl + c / ctrl + v"" basis. 

The second half of this album is a bit of a different story, though. ""Give Up the Ghost"" and ""Codex"" are a really nice break from the beats, but I can't help but feel a little underwhelmed by what's going on here. Nothing here hit me with the emotional impact of earlier albums.

When it comes to black metal, Vreid's V is as melodic and thrashy as they come. It's actually difficult to simply call it a black metal album.

The production is fantastic, and the musicianship is impressive during a lot of the solos, too. The issue I'm having with the album, though, is that it's not organized very cohesively, considering so many instrumental interludes basically hijack the songs until they're bordering on being directionless.

Sure, you could chalk it up to unconventional song structures, but I can't help but feel like I'm dealing with something different. This is no Agalloch we're talking about here.

Overall, I liked it. I'm basically talking about it because I think maybe some of you will like it more than me.

Mogwai's latest album is a potent concentrate of the band's usual formula. Rather than varying in volume throughout a given song, the compositions here concentrate on adding more and more layers of guitars, keys, and effects as each song progresses. It's pretty krautrock of them if you ask me.

I enjoyed this thing a lot. It may not round all of the bases of ""post-rock,"" but I'm fine with that. I've always known Mogwai to be a band that does whatever it wants, not satisfy the requirements of a certain style of music.

James Blake's debut album is loaded with gorgeous layers of synthesizers, beats, samples, and crooning vocals. When it comes to creating a series a pretty sounds, this guy's album spins like gold. 

There's more good than bad happening on this LP, certainly, but some moments here come of a little undercooked or short-winded when compared to heavyweights like ""Wilhelms Scream"" and ""Limit To Your Love.""

Besides, I've always been a little iffy on albums whose best--or second best--track is a cover.

In the end, this is another decent full-length debut from a fresh face. Blake could give his contemporaries a real run for their money in the future, but I'm sure many a reviewer will tell you he already is.

Cut Copy's latest album is sweet, danceable, and good-natured. There's no denying that. But the personality on this album--or lack of it, really--is what prevents this album from sticking with me. The vocal melodies and lyrics are pretty underwhelming, and the grooves don't hit as hard as they could.

Earth's first installment of Angels of Darkness, Demons of light is a hefty dose of the same medicine they've been feeding us since Hex in '05. When it comes to concocting musical sedatives, Earth's receptive is still pretty potent; however, I'm having trouble calling this LP as interesting as its predecessor. 

The most noticeable change this time around is some longer song lengths and a lot of bowed instrumentation. Of course, I'm a fan of the cello, but the production here doesn't exactly find a flattering place for it in the mix. Instead, it seems jammed in a spot that makes the guitar and bass stand out significantly less, which is really why I came to this showdown in the first place.

It's still dark and moody music. I'm just feeling a little less magic this time around. Maybe the sequel will be better.

Dumbo Gets Mad's debut album is a pretty hefty piece of psychedelic rock and pop. Rarely does anything about this LP come off as ""normal."" We're basically talking about an album full of odd synths, chipmunked vocals, bubble samples, and lyrics about prawns.

So it's hard to promote this simply as a ""rock album,"" because experimentation and effects play such a heavy role in shaping the music here. Think of it as FlyLo's Cosmogramma from a psych rock perspective.

Despite all the indulgence, the sounds here are great. This thing has a huge, warm sound that could have only come from an analog recording. The music an come off a little too hectic or cacophonous at times, but it wouldn't be much an adventure if the jungle wasn't dense with plants.

On John Vanderslices' latest album, the singer-songwriter works with California's Magik*Magik Orchestra to bring a new level of intricacy to his music. Nearly every song here is lavishly decorated with brass, woodwinds, and strings, but the live recording style keeps the music from feeling static or confined. 

Some songs pale in comparison to others, but at least the instrumentation swoops in to save the day when that happens. Though the album is definitely something Vanderslice fans should check out, it may be hard for a new listener to see the excitement or originality in a songwriter working with arranged instrumentation.

Braids' debut LP is a fun exercise in trippy, electronic psychedelia. The vocal and drum mixing and recording could have been a lot better, but the rest of this album is too good to deny. 

The pulsating synths bounce from one wall to another, the song lengths sprawl out into near endlessness, and the mood ranges from upbeat to dreamy without losing any momentum.

I wouldn't call it an amazing listen, but it's certainly interesting and engaging throughout. Considering this album is a huge improvement upon their previously released Set Pieces EP, I can't wait to see what changes the band makes when they put out something else!

2. Metal Sucks hates TND? http://bit.ly/gHkoM7

The Kurt Ballou-produced debut album of Norway's Kvelertak is a powerful piece of metal music. I heard about it last year on metalsucks.net, but refrained from commenting since there would be no way of picking up the album locally.

But now that this album should be getting a physical release in the US this March, I'm happy to talk about its amazing blend of rock 'n' roll and black metal--not to mention the sludgy, heavy production.

Some moments on this LP blend together for me, but it's still high-quality entertainment, build on good songwriting, mighty riffs, righteous guitar leads, and harsh vocals. It's as melodic as it is aggressive, and as accessible as it is heavy.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

2645,"The Decemberists- The King Is Dead ALBUM REVIEW (Iron & Wine, too!)","Listen: http://bit.ly/fbFSQc / http://bit.ly/eqFh9E

1. Holy Ghost! TRKRVW: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2628
2. Heidecker & Wood MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2594

The Decemberists' latest album, the King Is Dead, feels like a toned down version of the band's roots, for me. For some, it may be a welcome departure from the band's eccentric vocals and indulgent stories, but that's what made them interesting to me in the first place. Seeing these elements leave the stage makes this album very underwhelming for me. It's ultra-crisp production and mundane instrumentation only worsen my problems.

Colin still has a great presence, and the songwriting is still quite good; however, what these songs are shelled in is making me shy away.

As for Iron & Wine, Sam Beam is really venturing out of his safety zone this time around, and I'd say it's working for him for a good part of this record. Sam has always been a soft-spoken, intimate songwriter, so it's not surprising to feel as if he's being overshadowed by some of this instrumentation. The close connection Iron & Wine's old albums used to have seems missing here, and the production is no replacement--even if the quirky riffs and horns on ""Big Burned Hand,"" for example, are pretty fun.

There are quiet moments here that go over great, but a good chunk of this record doesn't feel all that personal or affecting.

What do you think of these albums? Love 'em? Hate 'em? Why? Am I an idiot for not praising them with the same vigor some reviewers are? What do you think of the directions these two projects are heading in? Is indie folk dead--especially considering that two of its biggest artists are now on major labels. Also, what should I review next?

1. An Interview w/VIMTV: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2602
2. VIMTV's channel: http://youtube.com/velocitiesinmusic

Destroyer's latest album is an unexpected change of pace from Dan Bejar and the gang. Rather than continuing to embrace the folk, glam, baroque pop aesthetics that brought the band this far, Kaputt emulates the sounds of disco, new wave, and smooth jazz.

At first, it was almost a shock for me to hear this, but don't take this album for a simple novelty or indulgence. Destroyer's songwriting and personality are stronger than ever on this record. Plus, the production is some of the best this band has had the opportunity to show off.

Whether it's a straightforward pop ballads, or a vast, ambient introduction on tracks like ""Bay of Pigs,"" this album's attention to detail, style, and poetic sensuality should seduce most who come into contact with it. I'm getting hot just thinking about it.

Deerhoof's 10th album is built on the same freewheeling creativity that has made their past LPs such fun listens. The album changes without warning from sound to sound and song to song, which only plays into the quirky attitude.

The only major downside is this band's ADD cuts some potentially gripping moments short. The album definitely loses some memorability in it's brevity, because some of the best tracks aren't around long enough to leave a lasting impression. 

The band's buzzing guitars, breezy vocals, and intricate drums are sounding better than ever. They chose the perfect time in their career to take on evil, I think. 

Deerhoof definitely wins this match, but I wish they performed a fatality.

1. Women split: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2545
2. Tennis TRKRVW: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2539

White Lies' sophomore album is built on the kind of cleanliness and safety post-punk's roots were spitting in the face of. The band completely avoids veering off of the path set before them by bands like Joy Division, Depeche Mode, and Interpol. If there's any alteration to the formula, White Lies does it with a bigger budget and sound. 

Of course, if I found the songs to be catchier, the lack of adventure wouldn't be such a big deal; however, that's not where we're standing.

On their sophomore LP, Smith westerns have cleaned up their act with better production, songs, and guitar licks. The hooks here are catchy as hell, and the melodies infectiously upbeat. It's nice to hear a band that can build songs both simple and complex with the same amount of energy.

The album does hold some issues in the vocal department, though. The band obviously tries to make up for it by drowning out a lot of the singing by playing louder and mixing the vocals lower. I'm not exactly sure how the problem can be rectified, but it's definitely taking away from the impact on a good deal of these songs.

JGCSOUND's review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gqqILdRcZ4

Ghost's debut LP, Opus Eponymous, is finally getting released in the US after gaining a lot of buzz across the pond in Europe. These guys play a style of metal that buffet picks different sounds genre's roots. It sounds kinda retro without directly referencing one single band, and I think that's where the real success is. It's like they've been able to go back in time and hammer out a nice for themselves in what already seemed to be a crowded area.

The lyrics are very cultist and satanic, but still catchy. The slightly deadpan vocals only make the sound eerier--along with the sinister organ, of course.

Aside from some abrupt fades and endings, I don't have many complaints here. It could be a little longer, but the songs are still strong and mighty!

1. Ghost track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2394

On Cage the Elephant's new album, the band spends more time copying than they do creating. Song after song, the band shows they've spent a lot of time studying the 90s. From post-hardcore to Pixies-esque alternative rock, there is a lot of history here. The problem is Cage the Elephant almost sounds unmistakably like some of these bands and tunes when they're playing. Yes, they play really well together, and the recording here is great; however, there's a serious identity crisis pervading this album throughout. This LP can definitely be a decent listen from a band who is undeniably enthusiastic, but I'm still left wondering who exactly this band is that's drowning in their influences.

On Wire's twelfth studio album, the band embraces the minimalism and simple pop hooks that make their post-Pink Flag albums so appealing.

The problem is that some of the songs feel a little off, and the production is no walk in the park. Colin Newman lays chorus effects on his vocals throughout the whole album, and the extreme amounts of compression on this LP make some of the tracks here sound like overmodulated crap.

I could see some moments on this album growing on me, but not by much.

Cake is back at it again with a new album of songs that tell odd tales and hit hard grooves. If you've heard any of the bands previous stuff, this won't be a surprise. However, this could be both a good and bad thing.

If you've loved Cake's sound for the past five albums, there's no reason not to check this thing out; however, it's easy to initially cast this album away for almost sounding too much like its predecessors.

The Souljazz Orchestra's new album doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does revive some important musical roots. The sounds of Latin music, afrobeat, and jazz-funk flow throughout this album, and blend to the point where it's hard to tell where one starts and the other ends.

3. Yesterday's review: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2149

Röyksopp's fourth album comes quickly on the heels of their third, and serves as a stark contrast to it's predecessor. Rather than solidifying their sound further with the electropop beats and guest vocalists on Junior, Röyksopp has released an album of weary instrumentals powered by retro synths and drum machines.

It's a great sound, but not all that distinct--especially considering how much electronica of this variety I've been able to enjoy this year. Though it's not an offensively bad record, I was having a difficult time finding anything unique or overtly interesting about it. There are a few times this album reaches an outstanding pique, but it doesn't keep the magic together long enough to warrant any heavy praise. However, that's just my opinion.

On Anika's debut LP, the English singer and Portishead's Geoff Barrow bring six covers and two originals through a post-punk and dub transformation. The album's sound is extremely interesting, showcasing Barrow's knack for channeling this particular era of music. However, Anika's vocals don't bring a lot to the table; plus, a lot of the instrumentation just seems thrown together.

I realize there are lot of mistakes and flubs left in here for effect, but deciding when or where this practice is actually interesting is a real gray area. I know there are plenty of mistake-filled records I've enjoyed in the past, but this just isn't one of them.

3. I Met the Walrus Short: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmR0V6s3NKk

Kids & Explosions' debut album is a spastic and relentless collage of pop's catchiest moments. Instead of allowing one sample to simply play over another, K&E dives in deep to each sample and tears it into little, tiny pieces; making everything work together rhythmically and melodically.

I realize some moments aren't all that subtle, and that this record gets pretty relentless with its edits; however, this interests me because it's the true meaning of collage music. 

Everything is destroyed and rebuilt using the scrap. Pretty inspiring. 

What do you think of this record? Love it? Hate it? Why?

2668,Skrillex- Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1685

1. Tonetta review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZOQBqCPQHc
2. Kids and Explosions album: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2073

Skrillex 2nd EP release this year features some pretty impressive mixes of progressive house, electro, and dubstep. It's a winning combination of raw experimentation and the desire to just make a fantastic dance track.

Unfortunately, not every song follows this formula. Skrillex reels in a lot of his eccentric edits on the second half of this EP, and the remixes tacked on the end are certainly decent.

He's just starting to build a name for himself with this stuff. While the entire release isn't mind-blowing, there are some highly enjoyable tracks that bring a lot of surprises and creativity to the table.

2669,Tonetta- 777 Volume One ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/hfPSW7

Tonetta's first full-length compilation is a great display of what this Canadian singer-songwriter has to offer: Mutant bedroom jams about sex, drugs, and more sex. Tonetta does touch down on politics, family, and other things on this album, but shock value is part of what makes this music so attractive.

The songs are pretty hit or miss for me, though, and it's hard not to feel as if something is missing when you're listening to the songs without the videos backing them up. Plus, chances are some of your favorite Tonetta songs aren't on this thing. If there's any reason to pick this up, it's so support one of YouTube's oddest entertainers.

Tyler,The Creator's full-length debut is a surprising collection of beats and rhymes coming from a teenage kid. On this album, Tyler lashes out against hip hop, his negligent father, and rap blogs. He says most things for the lulz, but it's hard not to laugh along with him.

There's a lot of darkness on this album, too, where Tyler creates a killing, raping, and kidnapping persona who shows little to no sympathy for anything. It's hard not to compare it to DOOM or Eminem's early work.

There are some pretty decent beats flowing throughout this thing, too. It's a little too indulgent, but that's the nature of this album. It feels like Tyler was making this music for himself, mostly, which is what makes it such an interesting listen.

2671,Daft Punk- Tron: Legacy SOUNDTRACK / ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/f3tE5Y

Review link: http://bit.ly/icKpX9 (THX 4 CLICKING)

The more I listen to the soundtrack, the more it seems Daft Punk was a great choice for this soundtrack. With arranger Joseph Trapanese, they've pulled together some really impressive combinations of electronics and acoustics. The 85-piece chamber orchestra makes this thing sound larger than life itself.

My main problem is that I can't really see myself enjoying this score outside of the movie itself, which has nothing to do with it being ""bad"" or ""mediocre."" My main problem is that the music seems so tailored to the movie--take into consideration the many short song lengths and abrupt song endings--that it feels like something is missing when I'm listening simply to this.

Whether or not this is a great soundtrack won't truly be known until Tron: Legacy is released, and Daft Punk fans are able to see the sound and sights tie together. That's the point of a score, isn't it? It's supposed to enhance your visual experience.

What do you think of this soundtrack? What about other soundtracks? Are you happy Daft Punk did this? Is it weird that this movie is produced by Disney? Do you think Disney is gonna turn Tron: Legacy into Toy Story 3000?

On First Four EPs, Off! gives punk music a well-needed wake up call. The riffs, drums, and lyrics all call back to that hardcore heyday when Black Flag was tearing it up. All 16 of these tracks don't even flirt with being two minutes long, and the rage in Keith Morris' voice is something to behold.

It's consistent, to the point, and forceful. What more could you want? Well, besides more.

2673,Maserati- Pyramid of the Sun ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/fzgvAl

Maserati's Pyramid of the Sun is a fantastic reinterpretation of the classic Krautrock sounds given to us by bands like Neu! and Tangerine Dream. Of course, this comes on the heels of a split the band released last year with he band Zombi, and it's all lead to Zombi member Steve Moore actually contributing quite a bit of synth work to this album.

The heavy production, keyboards, and extra melody makes this thing a huge improvement upon the sound the band forged on their 2007 album. If I were directing a fight scene in a huge action flick, this album would be my first pick for the soundtrack.

It's a great LP, but stops just short of amazing me. There are some points that could be drawn out a bit more, but I know a lotta people prefer their music to be more immediate than I do. If you think that's the case, jump on this album while you still can.

2675,Girls- Broken Dreams Club EP REVIEW,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1570

In comparison to their debut album, this EP is a real letdown for me. The weird personality and eccentricity seem to have melted away--or at least get a cover-up from all the new instrumentation on these tracks.

Many will say this release is a more mature direction, and that may be true; however, maturity isn't what brought me to the table in the first place. Album was an extremely fun release. It's quirks, experimental production, and strong pop hooks are what brought me into the fold; not pedal steel solos and forced drama.

There are some great songs on here, but there are too many moments and melodies recycled from the full-length debut to really go insane over the songwriting.

I realize many EPs are merely transitional periods for some bands, and I'm willing to accept that in this case. I'll be ready and waiting for the new Girls album when it drops, and I'm confident at least some of what made girls distinct to me will resurface.

NPR Stream (good 'til Nov 23rd): http://n.pr/b5L8uC

Two more perspectives on this album:
http://youtube.com/coverkillernation
http://youtube.com/threecreation

Agalloch's fourth studio album is an interesting followup to 2006's Ashes Against the Grain. Marrow of the Spirit is nowhere near as distorted or heavy, but the band manages to overcome that with a lot more melody, dynamics, and acoustic instrumentation.

There are still some really brooding moments, and the long song lengths only enhance the dark mood the music shoots for. John Haughm really works to change up his vocal style on some pivotal points of the album, and the entire experience is really cohesive and cinematic.

This is another triumph for the band's discography, but it  really shouldn't be a surprise considering how consistent they've been thus far.

Kanye's fifth studio album is easily his most ambitious effort yet. The production is extremely stunning. To be honest, this album sounds like a really huge undertaking with all of it's extra instrumentation, studio tricks, and samples.

Kanye has stepped up his rhyme game, too. It's also comforting to hear his guest MCs are rapping on his level. 

My one problem is I think someone would need to have some kind of interest in Kanye West as a person, or persona, to truly fall in love with this album. I, unfortunately, don't really care about the minor details of the guy's social life. He's got a lot of talent, but his relationships and various character flaws don't really pique my interest for the entire album. There are points where I can't help but cheer him on when he tells his personal tale of success, but I could take or leave the moments of contrived social drama. 

There's a lot to love about this thing. I'm just not won over on it personality-wise.

Cee Lo's third full-length is easily his most consistent and impressively produced. With an orchestra worth of instrumentation, Green chases after the classic soul sounds of Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield. And most of the time, he catches them.

With some looped drums and new studio sounds, he updates this timeless era of music, but it does get a little too clean and safe at times. There are a few tracks that just didn't do it for me, but there are still some clear standouts and winners. This LP definitely impresses beyond its slightly gimmicky single.

Matt & Kim's latest album is easily their brightest piece of pop. With a new studio sound, the band has basically sucked all of the rock and the danger out of their tunes; however, they have added a lot of muscle to their sweet side.

If their bright attitudes are what made their past efforts so attractive to you, this album won't leave you hanging. It's a decent release, but I've got to admit I've never been a big Matt & Kim fan. The sound has changed, but I can't say it's going in a bad direction--if anything, it's a simpler one, a nicer one, a catchier one.

It's nice, listenable, and bright, but maybe just not my cup of tea.

Kid Cudi's latest album has plenty of great production and a strong narrative running throughout. Like Janelle Monae's the ArchAndroid, it's extremely conceptual and blends hip hop with numerous generes. 

There's a lot of personal struggle and triumph on this album, but I can't say Kudi's personality is bright enough here to get me feeling as if I've got a stake in it all. I feel more like an outsider observing the those little battles people fight day by day.

What's painful to one person can be even more painful to another. I understand that; however, it's just hard for me to connect with this album on an emotional level. I'm impressed by the melodies and the beats, but I haven't been truly sucked in.

Small Craft On A Milk Sea is Brian Eno's next step in ambient music production. The soundscapes on this LP are vast and textured. Each song conjures an army of images that march through my head: infinite landscapes, endless skies, slow-motion deaths, and epic battles. 

There's a bit of an issue in terms of cohesion among these songs, though. It seems there might be some kind of theme if you were looking simply at the song titles, but there doesn't seem to be much stringing this album together from a sonic perspective.

However, the quality of these tracks is still high. If you're into exploring sound, then this is the album for you.

Electric Wizard's Black Masses is a psychedelic take on the band's classic formula of thick bass and heavy riffs. Some of these tracks are packed to the brim with electric guitar freakouts, phantom noises, and hidden drones; but other moments play it pretty straight, though.

The riffs can get a little nondescript, and a slightly muddy sound keeps Black Masses from becoming the powerhouse it should be.

It's a decent album, for sure. It just won't be the first I think of when the band's name comes to mind.

How To Dress Well is easily one of the eeriest lo-fi projects to come out this year. Its influences range from ambient electronica to modern R&B. 

The album has its impressive moments, but most of them are ruined by the shoddy sound quality. All the vocal peaking and overmodulation could be completely intentional. Either way, it doesn't change the end product.

It's like reading a great story loaded with bad grammar. The intentions are great, but a lot of beauty gets lost in translation on this LP. But that's just my opinion.

Squarepusher has taken on a whole new job on this new album. Technically, it's really the album of Shobaleader One, which is the name of the project Squarepusher is leading here. As usually, Jenkinson stirs up some surprising sounds and directions. He always keeps his fans guessing, and this is no exception. I like some of the songs here, but what's keeping me from loving the album is its tinny sound and its awkward mix. The robotic vocals are much louder than anything else on half of these songs, and the bass and guitars are way too processed. It's a great effort, and I expect better things in the future. I haven't given up on this idea. I just think the dust needs to settle a bit more on it.

Diamond Rings' debut full-length is a pop album that knows its limits, but shows no signs of shame or fear. The project's founder, John O, brings passion into everything  he touches on this album. The vocal delivery is ballsy, the synths are bubbly and playful, the drum machines invite thoughts of a bedroom dance party. There's a load of ambition here, but the only sad part is Special Affections lacks the power and the flash to bring it to the next level. However, I think that's something to be anticipated for the next album. For now, this'll do just fine.

2693,Warpaint- The Fool ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/agYPPo 

1. D-Pulse track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1557
2. MYTY KONKEROR MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1552

Warpaint's debut LP is an album of deeply hypnotic rock songs that slowly unfold with one phrase evolving into the next. It's an album that takes time to expose itself. It took me a couple of listens to really let the atmosphere of the LP surround me and hypnotize me. 

Sadly, the Fool doesn't end with the strength it starts. The band seems to drift away from the formula that made earlier tracks so great with an acoustic number, some prominent electronics, and heavy-handed piano chords. 

I still found the album to be enjoyable, though. It's just not making my eyes roll back into my head. There's clearly a lot of talent in this band, and I'm extremely happy to hear a new band with a female lineup that isn't falling into the same trend of Shangri-La worship.

Yourewrongimright's review: http://bit.ly/9GFLH1

On Black City, Matthew Dear constructs a world of dark, druggy lullabies and gothic disco anthems. Though it hops from style to style, the album maintains an extremely dark feel--even in the face of highly danceable beats. 

It borders on monotony at some points, and Matthew Dear definitely doesn't make a name for himself here as a wordsmith; however, the production and atmosphere on this album are too good to completely deny. I love most of the tracks, and I imagine any fan of electronic music would.

1. New Generationals MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1532
2. Eula Demo: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1528

Zach Hill's latest solo effort is just as abrasive and cacophonous as his last--but maybe there's even less restraint to be found here. While the album accomplishes what it sets out to do, that doesn't mean I'm enjoying it all that much.

If you're in the market for something that will make your eyes cross and ears run red with blood, head in this direction. But the album, for me, kind of straddles a weird spot between the accessible and experimental which just isn't agreeing with me. Sure, give me the accessible, or even put on a little noise music; but the combination of these two ideas on Face Tat just leaves me with an empty feeling. It's as if I've gained nothing from it.

1. New Flying Lotus video: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1519
2. New Wire song: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1523

On Come Around Sundown, Kings of Leon have crafted their most accessible album yet. The guitars shimmer over loads of warm bass and Caleb's signature vocal delivery. It's all very well arranged and produced, but I can't help but feel like the band has dulled down what made them the individuals that excited fans on their first few albums.

The album art is beyond appropriate for this album, though: An easygoing sunset. This setting is a nice place to visit. It's a calming image, for sure. But staring into a sunset for over forty minutes has never been a major interest of mine. I do know, however, there are plenty of people that would appeal to.

What do you think of this record? Love it? Hate it? Is it too underwhelming? Maybe not calming enough? How do you think it shapes up to KOL's past albums?

1. New Brian Eno track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1514
2. Fresh & Onlys music video: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1496
------------------------------------------------------------

The Gaslamp Killer brings some fantastic tracks to his latest EP, Death Gate, and really shows off his flare for producing. There's no reason to think this guy is going to live in the shadow of A Sufi and a Killer fame; plus, if any producer-DJ is going to give Flying Lotus a run for his money in the near future, it's this guy.

The major issue with Death Gate is it rarely keeps up a good pace for more than a minute and thirty seconds before it goes into an interlude or just ends. But that's kinda the nature of this thing since it's an EP. There's still a great feat. track w/Gonjasufi and a must-hear, 6-minute monster titled ""Shattering Inner Journeys.""

Though it's not making the loved list, there's still a lot to love about it. I'm excited to hear this guy's future output.

Avey Tare's Down There is certainly creative and packed with a lucid set of effects, but it's way too close to Animal Collective for comfort. The album willingly stands in the shadow of AnCo's more recent albums when Avey could have easily gone in a different direction. 

It's no doubt the the singing in rounds, the strange loops, and personal lyrics have their appeal. I'm just having trouble seeing that happen outside Animal Collective's current fanbase.

Sharon Van Etten's Epic is a real shot of ambition from the New York singer-songwriter. Some of these tracks are the catchiest Sharon has penned thus far in her short career. She hasn't forgot to venture into the unknown, though; bringing a few accordion drones and skeletal moments in the folk to keep what she does best fresh in her mind.

It's a little short of breath, but this release does have a decent run with seven tracks. It's definitely got me excited to hear what she does in the future.

Luke Abbott's first full-length album, Holkham Drones, is a deep dive into synthesizer worship. It maintains a vintage sound that calls back to the work of Kraftwerk, but still holds its own with contemporaries when it comes to adventure and experimentation.

2. Deerhoof MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1435

When it comes to garage rock, it doesn't get more gray and dreary than the Fresh & Onlys' Play It Strange. It's a spectral album of songs that relies more on its sound than its songwriting. And that wouldn't be a bad thing if there was just a little more variety on this album.

After the first several tracks, the opaque vocals and country twang start to take their toll and make me feel as if Play It Strange is a never-ending hedge maze where every turn looks like the one before it.

Belle & Sebastian's latest record follows suit with nearly everything they've done in the past. It's loaded with light and easygoing pop songs that make the perfect soundtrack for flying a kite or painting with watercolors. 

The unfortunate problem is much of this album sounds far too close to the releases preceding it. It's got some great pieces of songwriting here and there, but nothing to make it stand out as a significant peak in the band's fourteen years of material.

Delighted People review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCixPRPXCb8

Sufjan's latest LP isn't going to go down in history as one of my favorites, but it's not like it's all that bad either.

The Age of Adz delivers on all the talk of electronics that built up to it, but the sounds Stevens bring to the table aren't that dynamic or interesting--which is surprising considering how vast Enjoy Your Rabbit was.

I like the songs, lyrics, melodies, and orchestrations a lot. The electronic beats and production is really what kills it for me. I have no doubt that Sufjan's avid fans will love to hear him go down this avenue, but I just can't follow him too far down this road without feeling bored.

John Legend / Roots review: http://bit.ly/d9IGqm

Hip Hop instrumentals via Russia: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1395

It's nice to hear Mark Ronson get back into the swing of creating original material, but this album has way to many lows to warrant stopping the presses. The singles on it are extremely memorable, and blend hip hop and pop with ease; however, diving deeper into the tracks reveal a lot of filler, failed experiments, and sameness.

It attempts to genre cross, but only does so on a very minute scale. It's enjoyable at moments, certainly, but it just doesn't go far enough to keep me interested.

If you're in the market for something light, sweet, and beat-loaded, this will probably be a decent grab. But don't be surprised if the singles set the bar higher than the rest of the album's tracks.

Gonjasufi RMX LP: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1361

Twin Shadow's Forget is the stuff great debuts are made of: songs that get to the point; hooks that stay with you all day long; and the kind of production that begins to forge a distinct sound.

From disco to new wave to post-punk, this album seems to dabble in nearly every fusion of dance and rock music. It's a style of music I'm a bit of a sucker for, but I think the songwriting is too good to deny.

The album's major flaw is a slightly muddy recording quality. There are also some slight musical flubs here and there. Nothing that didn't stop me from enjoying it, though.

Tjutjuna LP stream: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1311

Abe Vigoda's new album, Crush, is the band's boldest move toward pop yet. However, it's not appealing to me like I  hoped it would. Vigoda's mixture of slightly experimental instrumentation, new wave synths, and crooning vocals is definitely well-intentioned, but it leaves many songs feeling somewhat bland for me. 

But please take this with a grain of salt, because this band never did too much for me in the first place. I was never in love with their stuff, but I found Skeleton and Reviver to be much more interesting than this. Hardcore fans will most likely be used to the ever-evolving sound Vigoda has been working with over the course of four albums. 

I don't want to give the impression that this LP is completely boring or a dingy lack of effort. In fact, the production of Crush proves this release is an intensely labored effort. This time around, you can just chalk the score up to this not being my mug of joe.

What did you think of this album? Fav track? Least fav track? What did you think of the sound? The vocals? Will Abe Vigoda change again on their next release, do you think?

Even shortly after the release of his previous after, the Tallest Man fails to disappoint or sound winded. Kristian Matsson fingerpicks and strums his way across five engaging tracks of heart-wrenching balladry. This guy writes songs for people who plan on hanging on his every word and note.

Women's new album isn't enjoyable for the same reasons most music is. There isn't an abundance of hooks or sweet melodies here. Instead, Public Strain is filled with a bleak, isolating tension. It's something that I've been looking for--subconsciously, maybe--in a 2010 record.

How haunting and alone this album feels is what makes it stand out so much. But I don't want to give the impression that this LP is nothing but a mopey, self-loathing piece of trash. It's far from it. It's more like the sound of one man's insanity after hearing nothing but silence for an entire year. A weird description, I know, but it's how I feel about this record.

Neil Young's latest LP is certainly heavy with effects and guitar distortion, but it doesn't hold my interest with the same power the heavy hitters in drone and doom do. There are some great songwriting moments on here, but the production just doesn't take things far enough. Though Neil sounds like he's swimming in a sea of noise, it doesn't come out that noisy on the listener's end. I want to be in le noise, too. Why should Neil get to have all the fun?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM1TueS2-1E

Coming in second only to Little Women's Throat, this album is the most abusive thing I've heard all year. It's pure, unadulterated testosterone. It's the kinda stuff that makes a perfect soundtrack to taking your shirt off and punching anything and everything withing arm's length. 

Over the course of this LP's 10 tracks, the band alternates ideas from hardcore, thrash, and grind. The breakdowns fit snugly against the flurries of drums and grinding guitar, too. 

I know I've given this a high score, but still want to say this album is not for everyone. It's only going to attract a very specific music fan: Someone who looks to put some real volume and intensity in their speakers. This thing isn't light-hearted or friendly by any means. If tooth-gnashing aggression is not what you want, then stay away from this thing. Far away.

Deerhunter's latest LP is easily one of their most immediate. It's not as loud as Microcastle's more abrasive points, but doesn't get nearly as quiet either.

Instead, this album sounds more like a full, fleshed out version of what frontman Bradford Cox was shooting for on his last solo LP, Logos. There's more acoustic guitar here, and the songwriting steals the spotlight more than ever--but without abandoning Deerhunter's signature set of psychedelic sounds and effects.

More albums like this, and Deerhunter will have quite the legacy going for them in 10 years.

Swans' new LP is a welcomed return of the New York band. But it's hard for me to see the group as something more than just a beefier version of frontman Michael Gira's solo work up to this point.

I believe Gira wants to legitimately bring the band back, and I wish him luck. I think with another LP, it's the rockier moments that will come off stronger than the acoustic ones. Because as of this point, the latter is the more memorable on this LP.

Black Mountain's latest LP doesn't carry on the prog-influences their last album endorsed. Instead, it's a pretty detour into the sounds of classic and folk rock.

I like that the band is changing things up, but they've come out sounding a little tame in the process. A little bit of adventure never hurt anybody, but I could understand the band wanting to make a more accessible record. It's just not accessing me as much, that's all.

2717,Black Milk- Album of the Year ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/aYOdKK / http://bit.ly/ab8vmv / http://bit.ly/dfDrD0

Black Milk may be a breath of fresh air from rap's mainstream, but he's nowhere near as innovative or interesting as his underground contemporaries--though he certainly does like to plug them all over this new album.

Generic beats, alright rhymes, and an almost anonymous flow should make this LP forgettable for just about any rap aficionado. It's not the most awful thing on the planet, and there are definitely some worthwhile moments; however, my ears are better off elsewhere.

Future Islands' new album makes me want to watch this outfit like a hawk. With this sound, I feel like the potential to put out something great. There are certainly some really bright moments on this album like ""Walking Through That Door"" and ""Swept Inside,"" but there are pieces that fall to the wayside in terms of songwriting or production quality.

Even though this release is over thirty minutes, it still comes off feeling like a disjointed EP, not a fully fleshed LP based on a cohesive theme. 

Still, the vocals, keyboards, and drum machines are a killer combo for these guys. I'm sure they could work with other dynamics, but there's definitely some room to grow here.

French garage rock: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1135

Chromeo's third album is their sweetest set of sounds yet. The heavy synths and disco rhythms make this thing instant and undeniable. Anyone who prefers their music with a dance beat will take to this pretty easily.

Though is does get cheesy at times, it's all part of the appeal. It's slick, cool, and well-dressed album. Though it's not the deepest thing to be released this year, it's not trying to be. 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Is dance music shite? Is there not enough of it? Does this album bring disco and funk back to life? Is Chromeo saving music?

NPR album stream (open until album's release): 
http://n.pr/bSDNpj

Blonde Redhead's Penny Sparkle is a big move toward softer and more sensual sounds. These ideas have always played a role in the band's albums in one track or another, but Redhead consistently explores this idea for 10 blissful tracks of sweet vocals and entrancing synths. It's almost a sexual powerhouse. 

I'm digging it a lot, but what do y'all think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why, why, why? How would you score it? What do you think of dream pop? Is it a term / genre? Does it apply here? Do you miss BR's old sound? Do you like this new one better?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT14DmukPF8

Let's get a couple things straight: Kevin Barnes is a great songwriter and of Montreal is one of the most interesting bands out there today. However, the jumbled, obnoxious, bizarre sounds on this album are turning me off without question. 

False Priest takes it down a notch with the electronics, but that hasn't stopped the music from coming off eccentric. Barnes' vocal delivery is more pronounced than ever, layering one wacky falsetto over another. 

There were a lot of highs and lows for me on this album, which will make for great conversation among fans. This band still has my admiration, but that doesn't mean I'm going to follow them everywhere they go.

What did you think of this album? Awesome? Not so awesome? What would you score it? What did you think of the band's last LP? Does anyone listen to Cherry Peel anymore?

Keith K. Interview: http://theneedledrop.tumblr.com/post/1076928302/keith-kenniff-is-a-boston-musician-with-several

It might seem impossible, but this album is actually somewhat solid. I can't say it's going to make history in Weezer's discography--maybe for it's cover--but it's certainly a bright spot considering its predecessors were Raditude and Red. 

Rivers' songwriting is still strong, and the band compliments them with their usual shtick. But here, they're at least sounding a little more natural than they have been these past few years.

Of course, it's never gonna be like the old days again, but this is LP won't be one of my reasons to complain.

Keith K. Interview: http://theneedledrop.tumblr.com/post/1076928302/keith-kenniff-is-a-boston-musician-with-several

Tera Melos' new album is both a complex and accessible step away from their Untitled LP. The hooks are more memorable, and the crystal clear recording quality is a fantastic compliment to the music; making every noodly riff very readable. It's relentless, but it has its moments of resolve. It's technical, but it has its moments of simplicity. 

Despite all there is to like, I'm not heavily into this album. That because this music sits in an awkward spot for me. It's somewhat catchy and it's somewhat intense. If I'm looking for intensity, I'll shoot for something like Hella or Little Women. If I want something catchy, I'll go straight for Weezer; not some middle-ground. However, this is only my mindset.

So take my score and feelings toward this album with a grain of salt. It's pretty entertaining, and I wouldn't be talking about it if I didn't think it was at least worth your time. Give it a listen and let me know what you think.

Miami Horror's new album didn't amaze me, but it's an undeniably definitive look at dance music's current obsession with mixing disco and house.

It got a little generic here and there, but no complaints other than that.

Interpol's latest album is easily one of their most varied. Lots of strings, piano, and horns bring a new dynamic to the band's sound. But the songwriting has suffered a bit as a result. Many of the tracks follow a linear model, building up instrumentation instead of changing it up between versus and choruses. Trying new things is grand, but I kinda just need Interpol to write me a bangin' rock song.

That does happen in a couple spots of the album, though. ""Barricade"" is undeniably catchy, and ""Summer Well"" is a good mix of Interpol's hook-writing magic and the added instrumentation.

But most of these tracks are too underwhelming and repetitive to keep me interested. This album isn't offensively bad, but I'm not really in love with it either.

Magic Kids' latest album is shamelessly corny, but that's what makes it so interesting. It's truly an enigma with its complex arrangements and non-stopped upbeat attitude. It's sad it's hitting ears at the end of the summer, because it might have made a killing at the beginning of it. 

Some of the songs are a little short, and not as developed, but this thing is still extremely impressive. It's a group of highly enjoyable pop vignettes.

Help me & vote 4 this SXSW panel: http://bit.ly/derDEI

New Blonde Redhead: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=924

Matmos' latest LP is a collaboration with the NY percussion ensemble So Percussion. Together, these two outfits hit just about everything with everything else, creating plinks, plops, bangs, and booms that build up into a minimalist wall of quirky sounds and simple melodies. 

Though enticing sonically, this album is a little bland stylistically. It seems Matmos and So are content to just indulge in each others' favorite thing: sound. Though there are spots of acoustic guitar, keyboards, and horns that break things up, much of this stuff blends together a little bit into something that could use a little more variation.

I still highly recommend checking out Matmos if you are still yet to, and I'm hoping So Percussion starts a consistent solo career soon--as opposed to the many collaborations their career has thrived on thus far.

This is a raw reaction to the new Animal Collective movie, Oddsac, delivered by my girlfriend and me. It's the strangest movie experience I've had all year, without question. These 55 minutes are based around lush, ever-changing visuals, which segue into surreal live action vignettes of monsters, a drummer, campers, and spinning fire. 

If you're looking for something simply, easygoing, and cohesive, this is absolutely not the film for you. This movie is specifically targeted who like something a little disjointed and varied. It's a gift for anyone who likes to leave a film scratching their head.

Some of the effects impressed, and some didn't. Some of it was corny, and some of it wasn't. All that's clear is this really was weird. A little indulgent, too.

Arcade Fire review: http://bit.ly/9ZKqry

On their fifteenth studio album, Iron Maiden has refined the progressive elements they relied on with 2006's A Matter of Life and Death. Many of the intros and instrumental passages are drawn out, but they add more to the songs than they take away. My biggest issue with the album is Bruce's voice. It's really the only part of the band that shows any age. He can't hit the highs like he used to. And though the strain is only apparent on a handful of tracks, the spots where it does show up are ruined. Examples include bits of ""Mother of Mercy"" and ""Starblind."" There are even points where Bruce runs himself breathless by writing more lyrics than he can chew.

All that aside, the songwriting is still catchy and detailed. The production could certainly be better, but there's still a love of exploration and adventure in this band's songwriting; plus, Maiden is easily the best-looking when it comes to their contemporaries. I'd rather listen to this 40 times before I listen to a new Ozzy album once, that's for sure. 

The band is still kicking and still relevant.

On their first album in six years, Autolux enhances the experimental sounds they forged on 2004's Future Present. Tracks like Audience No. 2 bring are a real sensory overload, packing the mix with distortion and effects. But the album has a few severe potholes that leave me underwhelmed. Whether it's looping instrumentation or a lack of interesting sounds, some tracks just leave me cold and uninterested. It's nice if you're looking for a friendlier face in this style of music, but I'd rather hear the dangerous side I've come to appreciate from Autolux.

On the Budos Band's third album is the first time I feel really lost on the band.

The band clearly doesn't want to repeat their past efforts, but they've made a bad switch by exchanging their sense of exploration for a moodier direction.

On Arcade Fire's latest album, they take the most ambitious and immediate elements of their previous albums, and feed them into americana-style songwriting. Standing at an hour, it's a long freaking album, and it's thematic, too. If you're a fan of AF, this album won't be a surprise, and should prove to be a real show of growth.

The Books interview: http://bit.ly/cboXUy

On Wild Nothing's debut LP, singer-songwriter Jack Tatum follows the path laid out before him by his dreampop forefathers. He doesn't exactly make his own mark, but if you're looking for a sincere and passionate reenactment of 80s indie pop, lay your ears on this album pronto.

On Best Coast's debut album, the project really brings what the singles promised: sunny songs for the summer heat. Lots of distorted guitars, reverb-soaked drums, and lethargic lyrics. It's a nice formula, but it's not exactly the kind of place I want to be for thirteen songs straight. Unfortunately, there's not much variation among these songs, and it's hard for me to fall in love with this album because of it. There are a few standout tracks, but no reason to stop  the presses. 

If you're looking for an album that'll soundtrack your summer, though, this should be your next stop. What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Why? Hate it? Why, oh, why!?

On Paramatma, Mono/Poly digs into the same sandbox artists like Flying Lotus, Ras G, and Daedalus have. He flirts with hip hop, electro, dubstep, but fails to hammer out a sound that separates him from his contemporaries. Overall, the album is a little disjointed, but there are still a lot of standout tracks that have me looking forward to what this guy may put out in the future. If you can appreciate any of the artists I mentioned at the top of this paragraph, play Mono/Poly and see what happens.

On Baths debut LP, we've got enough colorful beats to smother a chillwave producer. Dreamy synths, sharp snares, and sweet vocals make this album a pretty easygoing experience. It's undeniably instant, but there's a lot to learn from repeated listens. There's a lot of detail in the production, added with unexplainable noises, pianos, and faint keyboards.

There were a few moments I didn't care for, which I attribute to the falsetto vox, but I've got to give credit where it's due. This LP is creative, engaging, and fun. What did you think of this album, though?

/\/\ /\ Y /\ causes as much racket as its predecessors, but the shroud of noise doesn't cover the plain song structures. One of the most disheartening things about this release is the drought of musical influences from around the world. This thing heads deep into experimental electro territory, producing some pretty straightforward moments like ""XXXO"" and ""Tell Me Why.""

But aside from dipping her toes into dubstep on several tracks, I fail to see how MIA has really advanced past Kala. Instead of moving forward, it feels like she's stepped to the side, experimenting more in some areas and watering down her eccentricities in others.

http://www.mountwittenbergorca.com/

This is a helluva collaboration right here. Hearing Bjork's vocals intertwined with that of Dirty Projectors makes me wonder why this didn't happen sooner. The fragile instrumentation on this mini-album doesn't live up to the high-end production on Bitte Orca, but it doesn't need to. The vocals are absolutely stunning--even if they aren't dressed up. The melodies and harmonies are absolutely gorgeous, and the time constraints put on Longstreth in the writing of this album has led to a batch of tracks that are surprisingly immediate. For those who have taken the 'Projectors as a difficult band may want to give this a listen.

It's a great collab, but who knows if its time will be kind to it. It might translate best to hardcore fans of these two musical acts, but that doesn't mean it's not of a high caliber.

WATCH THIS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7dqK1yn9Gs

On Desert Fires Sarah Lipstate takes it easy on the ears she tore to shreds on her previous album; heading in a more serene direction with her guitar-driven noise and drone. Many of these tracks follow clear chord progressions, and feature rushing waves of sonic swells in the background. It never gets mind-blowingly loud, but that's not really the point this time around. Instead, this LP is a much more calming experience. A little more bleak, a little less unsettling.

On his first full-length debut, Big Boi calls on nearly everyone in the biz to come on his record to rap, sing, and produce. Though it's awesome to see such a star-studded list of guests, it's lead this album into some extremely unbearable inconsistency. It seems some tracks are content to be overly sappy or obnoxious just because there's a great guest in the mix. 

There are some real barn-burners on this LP, but way too many low points to start singing this record's praises in the streets. Feeling kinda ""meh"" on this, but what do you think of this record? Love it? Hate it? Why?

On Wavves' latest album, singer-songwriter Nathan Williams teams up with the late Jay Reatard's old rhythm section to assemble twelve summer rock anthems. This LP should tickle fans of all this noise rock and pop floating about the blog-o-sphere these days from acts like No Age and Vivian Girls. However, there's a huge pop/skate punk influence informing these songs, too: The Queers, the Mr. T Experience, Screeching Weasel.

Just rock to this thing and let me know how you feel. Who cares who Wavves is? Who cares about the drama, bullshit, and news items that have come up over the past year or so? If it's decent music, it's decent music, and I feel it is.

RMX WED: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=292

On their 9th album, the Roots have kept their sound soulful and sobering. This album is the sound of recovery, and the point of view of a human being with a long road of improvements ahead. Great beats, piano, and rhymes make this thing too powerful to deny; plus, the guest spots from Monsters of Folk, Joanna Newsom, and John Legend put some real separation between the tracks. It really is a great album, and a high point for hip hop in 2010.

These Are Powers: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=217

On their third LP, Wolf Parade pull together their most cohesive sound yet. The differences that separated the band's two main songwriters, Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug, are slowly disappearing. The loud, voluminous production on this release makes for a highly visceral experience, but Dan fits into this mold much easier than Spencer does. It's the most no nonsense this band has ever been, but they've dampened their idiosyncrasies a bit in the process.

This is still an admirable record, though, and one hardcore fans are probably going to enjoy more than me. But what do you think of this album?

This compilation is a 20-track snapshot of the Kuckuck label's humble beginnings. The record company came at a time when experimental rock--dubbed ""krautrock"" at the time--was getting into full swing, and experimenting with jazz, folk, and synths. There are a lot of left curves on this release; including film music, some spots of minimalism, and a little noise, too. Overall, a ton of variety, and a fun, exciting look at a lost rock relic.

On their latest album, Emeralds take a slightly different approach than they did on 2009's What Happened. There's a lot less distortion, noise, and lengthy explorative tracks on this new LP. The band chooses to keep things short and sweet, sticking to tracks that mostly range from three to four minutes. But a lot happens within these time constraints: sharp guitar solos, bubbling synth arpeggios, and warm electronic chords gently pulsate in an ambient fashion. Very pretty colors and extremely promising instrumentation. But to go back to the song lengths: the shorter amounts of time really do choke off how much the band and the listener are able to explore a given musical idea. This isn't pop, and there's no reason for some of these tracks to be this abrupt. Venture into the unknown a little.

Though this new LP is business as usual, her ability to pull apart society's problems is still sharp. Cold electronics and abstract lyrics make this thing dance the same surreal steps Big Science did, but the slightly updated tricks still work, believe it or not.

On her full-length debut, Janelle Monae doesn't just hit out of the park. She goes all Dragon Ball Z and wallops it with the force of a thousand super saiyans. All animae references aside, this thing is great for dozens of reasons: immediate, conceptual, varied, and engaging. There's not a moment where I felt underwhelmed. The most out-of-place track has to be the Of Montreal collaboration on ""Make the Bus,"" which isn't doing too much for me. Outside of that, I can't really say anything bad about this album. It's a revival of jazz, funk, and motown fundamentals with a contemporary kick.

A really chill mood pervades this entire release, but much of the time I find myself wanting more. I wish this thing took a few more chances; however, I still have to give huge props to the musicianship and the crisp, clean production. 

Is it an awful album that you should steer clear of? No. It's simply not my cup of tea is all. Foals are very passionate about what they do on this album, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like it, but I would recommend this for anyone looking for some tight, danceable indie rock.

Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti have come up with their cleanest-sounding album with Before Today. Pink's obsession with new wave, glam rock, disco, and post-punk continues as usual, but the strange, surreal recording tricks crowding his earlier work aren't as prevalent.

Though the songs are still great--really great, in fact--longtime fans may be a little disheartened by the overall lack of ""weirdness."" Many of these tracks are simply reworked versions of ""classic"" songs from the Haunted Graffiti discography, so Before Today may not be much of anything new for some; but the cleaner, more accessible approach will surely blow the minds of some first-timers.

2772,Sleepy Sun- Fever ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/b7C6EK / http://bit.ly/drEhY0

SS's first album: http://bit.ly/9WFHKc

Villagers stream @ NPR: http://n.pr/byVyxR

Sleepy Sun's sophomore LP has got the ambition, musicianship, and emasculate production timeless rock records are built on. This release has some really strong songs, burning melodies, memorable solos; there's just a lot going for it, to be frank. I didn't care for the sedate vocals one hundred percent of the time, but that's a matter of personal taste I can easily look past when a record is this good.

What do you think of this album? Have you heard it? You should! if you have, do you love it? Hate it? Why?

2773,Melvins- The Bride Screamed Murder ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/d0v78J / http://bit.ly/bpW4LU / http://bit.ly/awh0j6

Cool Kids mixtape: http://www.coolxkids.com/

On their 20th album--20th if you count their collab albums w/Jello Biafra and Lustmord--Melvins sound as evil as ever. Their taste for abusive distortion and percussion has not waned, but the band has grown a lot more absurd on this release. Weird, transitional moments feature squelching horns, weird vocals, and funny keyboards. The strangeness bleeds into some of the tracks, too: ""PG x 3,"" ""The Water Glass,"" and the band's cover of ""My Generation."" 

Some of the moves Melvins make on this album make me question their sanity, but I know for sure the band hasn't lost it. Songs like ""I'll Finish You Off"" show they can be the powerhouse we've come to know and love. 

The Melvins are gonna do what they're gonna do. Gotta respect that, but that doesn't mean I'm going to love every minute of it. I'm kind of indifferent on this LP as a whole, but what do you think of it? Love it? hate it? Why? Also, what's your fav Melvins LP?

2774,Tame Impala- Innerspeaker ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/9SYvrY / http://bit.ly/cUVO0L / http://bit.ly/diW86Q

Tame Impala brings back the sounds of 60s psych like it's nobody's business, but I can't help but feel like the band is more of an exercise in nostalgia than anything else. 

The accuracy Tame executes these sounds with is almost unprecedented, but I'm still having trouble seeing this LP as standout or highly-enjoyable. Personally, I've enjoyed a lot of music like this throughout my life, and fail to see how this album brings anything different to the table. There are some newer and interesting sounds on it, though.

If you're looking to get into psych, though, I'd highly recommend this.

2775,Guilty Simpson- OJ Simpson ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/blGdFA / http://bit.ly/ce2plL

On their first full-length collaboration, Madlib and Guilty Simpson come up with some pretty stunning moments; showing these guys might be a match made in heaven. However, the chance to really observe these two at their best doesn't really happen here. Even this album's best songs feeling weighted down by the enormous amount of filler on this LP. About half of this album is made of intros, preludes, outros, interludes, and intermissions. Many of these transition tracks are longer than the songs themselves, which is kinda depressing. If this thing were split up into an EP, it would be a much stronger release; because at this point, OJ Simpson takes way too many breaks to keep up the fantastic momentum some of these songs bring.

My mix submission: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=86

(As of right now, NPR Music has a stream of this album up.) Ratatat's LP4 isn't the strongest piece of evolution in the duo's canon, but they're arguably doing what they do better than ever. Tons of great grooves, color, arrangements, and instrumentation, here. There's a lot more bravery in the song structures, too. Some naysayers might say this album is a copy of a copy, but I think it's more of a well-developed variation on the same Ratatat theme.

2777,Xasthur- Portal of Sorrow ALBUM REVIEW,"Listen: http://bit.ly/cx83QN

For his last album Xasthur has pulled together some production and sounds that dwarf what we heard on his previous album, All Reflections Drained. But sonically is the only way the work here advances. In terms of structure and melody, this album is still very much made of interludes that range from sort of engaging to not so engaging. Some of the musicianship is appallingly sloppy, too, which can make it difficult to take the dark moods of this album seriously. I like the sounds, but not much else.

What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Hate it? Is this a good or bad end for Xasthur? Are you looking forward to Conner's forthcoming projects?

On this new LP, Tobacco has arguably improved upon his sound, but is this new LP all that different from what we've heard from him and BMSR in the past? It's a decent album, with a lot of great songs, but I find myself cherry-picking some while throwing others at the wayside. It's a fun LP, and you shouldn't expect the world of it.

Brooklyn's Sleigh Bells break pop's volume barrier with extreme prejudice. The music here is highly compressed, distorted, and manipulated for maximum sonic terror. I like the noise pop approach, but the vocals seem so contrived and boring. Not only that, but there's not much going on in the beats aside from some simple cuts and pastes. I've gotta give it to this album for being one of the loudest records of this year, but that doesn't mean I have to strap on spandex tights and enjoy it.

The Black Keys have come back with a return to their classic sound on Brothers; concentrating on making their drums and guitar foundation sound better than ever. The band brings in some great variation, too, making sure each track sounds different than the next. They've learned from their past experiences, and are improving upon their style; however, it's kinda difficult for me to say this album overthrows classics like Rubber Factory. I don't think it does, but this LP is still highly enjoyable. Lots of consistency and great production, too. I wish there could have been some more contrast in the songwriting department, though.

RIP Dio: http://yhoo.it/aGpnKJ

LCD Soundsystem's third and final album is an ambitious trip into the sounds of dance and rock fusion. A lot of strong influences coming from the 70s and 80s on this one--especially from the realms of post-punk, disco, and new wave. I already have an affinity for this music, so it was fantastic to hear a modern band just do it right. LCD has really built upon a classic sound this time around; bringing a style back with sincerity, and putting their own spin on it, too. Great songs, melodies, lyrics, and grooves. Hardly a scratch on this thing. I felt a little underwhelmed by one track, and I'm happy that's my biggest complaint. I can hardly nit pick on this thing.

The Dead Weather's latest LP is a deep exploration into eleven shades of badass blues rock. Jack White brings some great guitar sounds so the mix, and overall the production is just top-notch. My one issue is with the vocals and vocal deliveries. It sounds almost as if White and Moss are trying too hard to have soul, I'm not sure. I've heard White sound a lot more natural on his previous efforts, and wish that same feel came across on this album, too. I figure my issue with the vocals will probably be some tick that I'm only feeling, heh. Maybe I'm crazy.

What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Hate it? Is it better or worse than Horehound? Remember that band ""the White Stripes""? Yeah, they were cool.

This latest Porns record might not be their most consistent, but it's clearly their most orchestrated. This thing has a plethora of instrumentation and strong-as-hell songwriting. The Bejar songs are seductive, and the Case songs are catchy. They could have let up on the group singing, though. Great pop hooks, and very few complaints. Light & sweet, my friends, light & sweet.

Review of Songs of Shame: http://bit.ly/cOgDF7

Brooklyn's Woods specialize in creepy, haunting folk rock, fronted with some distinct falsetto vocals. It's like a dead creepy guy singing in my ear. Y'all may remember I loved their last album, Songs of Shame, and At Echo Lake is a worth follow-up, for sure. There's more variation and a slightly more upbeat attitude. I just wish this band would bite the bullet and come out with something a little more fleshed out, but the style here is still unique enough to keep me interested, really interested.

The National's latest is loaded with lush production and somber vocals, but the album may be a little too melancholy for its own good. The sadness here isn't dark or wild. If anything, it's a shade of faded gray. Imagine that going on for almost 50 minutes, and it gets a little meh. But if that emotion is where you wanna be, make sure you hit this album up. Though I didn't like every track on here, there is a group of real winners. ""Anyone's Ghost,"" ""Sorrow,"" and ""Conversation 16"" are beautifully crafted, and give a lot of attention to detail. I'm a little mixed on this, but how do you feel about this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

There's a huge step up with studio production on this album, bringing a lot more clarity into the fold. If only the band brought the extremely improvisational feel of LP to Latin, too. HF is clearly evolving, and this album is an interesting part of that process. Fun, colorful album with some nice replay power.

Let me start by saying this album is awesome; however, I understand the noisy, disturbing, abusive sounds this Brooklyn quartet makes are not for everyone--not even a little bit. If disorienting musical aggression isn't your thing, I understand. But if it is, then your ears need to be on this band's debut full-length. This group features elements of math rock, free jazz, metal, and punk sped up until they've disintegrated into a fine powder that gets you pretty messed up when snorted. Lots of replay power, great sounds, and raw musicianship. How are we gonna know what's pretty if we don't hear the ugly? This rules.

This latest track from the Black Keys' upcoming Brothers is a decent track, but I can't help but hear the band walk down their own beaten path on this one. ""Tighten Up"" had some much more definitive qualities to it, but it's hard to ignore BK falling into the same exactly sun-baked retro-rock formula that brought them where they are today. Nothing inherently wrong with this track, but maybe just a little too familiar. Probably a decent intro for first-time listeners, and I'm still expecting this LP to rule.

I found their previous albums much more engaging, adventurous, and distinct. Though it's tough to nail BSS down due to their plethora of different styles, these previous releases at least had some semblance of originality. This album seems content to take absolutely no chances, and touts some pretty subtlety-smothering mixing. No reason to give up on BSS entirely, but I can't say I'm going to spend any more time on this album this year.

Crystal Castles latest album isn't exactly a reinvention of the electronic duo. I can't say they've gone v2.0 on us. Maybe it's more like a v1.4. Many of the tracks sound similar to those on the first album, but the ones that don't are more than interesting. For the most part, the album is a pretty chilly, reserved experience, saving most of its aggression for the track ""Doe Deer.""

See jumblejunkiemusic review this LP: http://bit.ly/cUL33K

Darkthrone's latest album, Circle the Wagons, is a ballsy piece metalhead artillery. The guitar sounds are fantastic, and the drums are the perfect compliment to how brash the music is. However, I have to say this is one of those instances where one isolated part of this music is ruining the whole thing for me: the vocals. Whether it's the recording or the mixing, they sound so tinny and out of place. It's almost as if the vocal tracks were meant for a different album.

The music is still undeniably catchy and brutal, but I just wish the vox lived up to that same standard. 

Circle the Wagons is a shot of hardcore adrenaline. I tend of overanalyze things, and this isn't exactly an ""anylazation"" kind of album. If you're looking for pure guts and a ""fuck off"" kind of attitude, this is where you wanna be.

I think HB is on the verge of garage greatness, but I can't say more than that. I don't see why this LP wouldn't earn them a devoted cult following, but I'm gonna wait a bit more before I blow out the candles.

Caribou's latest album is undoubtedly one of Dan Snaith's most accessible releases, but he still manages to keep his usual experimentalisms in the fold. 

There are some fantastic grooves on this album, but there were some moments that sort of felt like ""work in progress"" or just put in place for the sake of getting the sound or idea down on paper--not necessarilly becuase it made a great track or song. 

If you've enjoyed Snaith's past releases, this is worth your time. I'd also recommend it to Four Tet fans, Pantha Du Prince fans, and Arthur Russell fans. If you value adventure and stretching out, this is probably where you want to be. But for those who might want their music accessible, Swim is heavily lined with dance beats, so there's no reason to fear for your attention span.

Decent album. Just some mixing moments I wasn't down with completely, and just felt some tracks paled in comparison to others--for example, Odessa, Leave House, Bowls, Hannibal.

2802,LCD Soundsystem- Drunk Girls Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/cLK8Sw

""Drunk Girls"" comes from LCD Soundsystem's upcoming album, This Is happening, and it's an incredibly promising single. It's weird, comedic, and looking for someone to dance with--preferably a drunk girl, but I don't think it's picky. The track isn't incredibly detailed, but it's got some great production and a load of energy. I'm digging it heavy, and really looking forward to the new LP.

What do you think of the track? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Also, did you happen to notice I'm in a freaking record store? Record store day is tomorrow, folks. On 4/17, are you gonna hit up your local recstore? If so, what one are you heading to?

2803,Iggy and the Stooges- Raw Power Review (Legacy Remaster),"Look: http://bit.ly/dd47OU

Listen to Iggy Mix: http://bit.ly/2XBnrw

Listen to Rough Power mix: http://bit.ly/1iBVBA

Listen to Bowie Mix: http://bit.ly/bgfwhG

The Stooges' Raw Power is one of the most dangerous albums in rock. It makes guys like G.G. Allin look like a kitten, and that's no lie. Despite it's great songs, attitude, and approach, the LP as always suffered from mixing issues. It was originally mixed in '73 by Iggy Pop, but then by David Bowie after Legacy was unhappy with the original version. In '97, the album was remixed again, and Iggy was in charge this time around. The result was one of the most compressed, punishing musical experiences I've ever had. A lot of people got down on the distortion and the imperfections of that '97 version, but that sound was clearly the '73 intent when you compare it to the very first mixes, which were issued in '95 via a compilation titled Rough Power. Though I'm not a fan of the Bowie mix, because it's way too tinny and devoid of drums, it's still a piece of rock history. It's good that it not go completely into obscurity, but I still can't say it's the go-to place to hear the Stooges' real, raw power. I'm still a big fan of the Iggy version, and would like the guide all the new potential Stooges listeners to that particular release. Fans of the Bowie mix will find this remastered version pleasurable, and the live performances on this LP aren't bad, too. This edition is just more of a collector's item than an absolute interpretation, for me. 

If you haven't done it yet, listen to the Stooges. Their self-titled, Fun House, or the Iggy Pop remix of Raw Power are where it's at. 

Have you heard this LP? What do you think of it? Love the Stooges? Hate 'em? Why? Bowie mix vs. Iggy mix?

2804,The Tallest Man On Earth- The Wild Hunt Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/7HLNMJ / http://bit.ly/9zjvNZ

This sophomore album from The Tallest Man On Earth is an unbelievably fresh look at folk music. This album is built from the earth, but doesn't feel archaic like something from the heydays of Woody Guthrie or Leadbelly. This thing doesn't even feel as old as America's folk revival in the 60s. Though there is some obvious Bob Dylan influence going on here, I'm sure The Tallest is equally conscious of his contemporaries like Neil Young, Phil Ochs, or Townes Van Zandt. 

Poetic lyrics, picturesque descriptions, great guitar work, and strong songwriting. Not much here in terms of a new or innovative sound, but that's completely unnecessary in this instance. Check this one out, guys.

2805,Titus Andronicus- The Monitor Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/bBVFdC / http://bit.ly/d2ayBf

Titus Andronicus have just put on a phenomenally brave and ambitious sophomore album, The Monitor. The tracks on this LP revolve around the American Civil War, and there's not a portion of this album that theme doesn't touch. There's a lot of righteous punk bravado going on throughout this LP, which makes it attention grabbing, but will that attention maintain over the duration of these heavy song lengths. Many of the tracks number from 7-8 mins, and the longest of the bunch is 14. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it will take numerous listens to wrap your head around this rock 'n' roll giant.

Have you heard this album or any of the tracks from it? If so, what do you think of it? Love it? Hate it? Why?

2806,Deftones- Diamond Eyes Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/akDxmX

This is the first single from Deftones' upcoming album, Diamond Eyes. The LP is due in May, and I certainly hope this song isn't a sign of what's to come. Though this track isn't outright awful, it's a big step in a less experimental direction--even when you compare it to previous singles such as Minerva. The toss back and forth between the extremely plain riff and the wall-of-sound chorus wasn't anything to get up in arms about, to be frank; but it's still nice to see this band's return to music after 2006's Saturday Night Wrist.

And much like that album, I'm sure Diamond Eyes' other tracks will offer much more engaging, thought-provoking ideas than this single.

This first single from Dum Dum Girls' debut album is a catchy piece of sunbaked garage pop. There's a bit of apathy to the music I'm not a huge fan of, but DDG is a group you must be into if the sounds of Black Tambourine, Vivian Girls, or Best Coast get your musical goat. Though it didn't blow me away, I do have respect for this sound. Give it some ear time and let me know what you think?

jumblejunkiemusic http://bit.ly/awHkgs
sirallaboutmusic http://bit.ly/9dBuHR
coverkiller http://bit.ly/dlkCwy

This album is Burzum's 7th studio album, and Varg Vikernes' return to releasing music. His last album was released in 1999, and was recorded while in jail. Of course, Varg's two jailtime LPs went in a much more ambient direction, Belus is a comparative shock. This album is loud, harsh, and distorted as the flaming, demon-filled pits of hell. Though we expect black metal to have a lo-fi sound, the massive amount of guitar on this album has to be due to some lackluster production. Burzum's previous LPs are much less repetitive and have a better sonic balance--even though they're comprised of lo-fi recordings, too. Though it's cool to see that Varg is getting back into the saddle, I can't say this is all that exciting or interesting as a standalone piece of music. Varg's infamous reputation is fueling a lot of hype around this album, but the music simply fails to live up to it.

2809,Black Tambourine Anthology Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/dgD7gN / http://bit.ly/C9HQh

This new compilation CD from Black Tambourine covers all of this short-lived band's recordings. For two years, this DC outfit blended their love of Phil Spector and the UK's shoegaze movement into a unique brand of noise pop. It's weird to hear such sweet, haunting songs nailed onto a harsh wall of distortion, but that's what made Black Tambourine Black Tambourine. Though these guys never hit it big--and probably never will--they're undoubtedly a big deal to bands like Vivian Girls, Dum Dum Girls, and The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. If those bands are topping your Last.fm charts or getting a lot of replays on your MP3 player, then Black Tambourine should be your next musical destination, for sure. Even if they don't win you over completely, their obscure place in American independent rock history is something to appreciate.

2810,Jonsi- Go Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/dq4y2H / http://bit.ly/6xPThE

Parlophone album sampler: http://bit.ly/cNMYUe

On Jonsi's solo debut, the Icelandic singer and guitarist explores numerous sides of his musical psyche. There are tight, full, lush tracks with a really immediate feel. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are some really atmospheric tracks that take their time building. Though each moment is just as creative as the next, Go does suffer from some stylistic inconsistency. Whether or not you like this LP is really gonna be based on how well you can keep up with Jonsi as he jumps from one sound to the other. I find myself favoring the slower tracks, but I'm positive there will be people who feel otherwise. If you can keep up with all the shifts this album makes, all the more power to you.

2811,Autechre- Oversteps Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/bm19kG / http://bit.ly/bKau3d

http://www.theneedledrop.com

Autechre's 10th album, much like their nine previous efforts, brings challenges, experiments, and bewilderment. The duo is as abstract as they've ever been, heading in a softer, more ambient approach for this release. The gentler direction resembles that of their 1994 album Amber, but with a wider sonic vocabulary. Oversteps doesn't offer much in terms of clear song structures, too. It's an album that would much rather explore than plan out a route. 

To be honest, I found their last album to be a lot more thrilling, but what works for me might not work for you. If you're looking for something that quietly cuts its way through the digital jungle. Oversteps should be your destination.

2812,The Morning Benders- Big Echo Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/5ZWLSg

Live performance of ""Excuses"": http://bit.ly/d68JtP

On this latest album, California's The Morning Benders step up their studio production and shoot for a a new direction with their music. With Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor getting co-production credits, it should be no surprise Big Echo is sounding a lot like his band's previous efforts.

For me, this new approach is having some really mixed results. Some of the added instrumentation and interludes distract from the songs more than they add. The constant interludes take each track through detour after detour without showing anything all that scenic, to be honest. 

There are some real bangers on Big Echo, though. They just happen to be the most straightforward songs. There's no reason to lose faith in this band, but this album is clearly the sound of them executing their new-found ideas for the first time.

2813,MGMT- Congratulations Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/ETLa

This review is obviously much earlier than the April 13th release date of this album, but Congratulations is currently all over the net--and even streaming at NPR Music at the time of this video's upload. MGMT's Congratulations makes me want to say this to the band: Congratulations. It's a neo-psych rock drama, bursting with cinematic tracks. A real solid beginning-to-end listen. Some songs pale in comparison to others, but Congratulations still avoids falling prey to high highs and low lows. This music is a modern day take on the rock guys like Bowie, The Beatles, and Arthur Brown were playing with back in the day, and it even takes the time to pick up some new wave and post-punk influences, too. MGMT is clearly well-versed in the language of rock, and this album is a result of the fluency.

2814,Portugal. The Man- American Ghetto Review,"Listen: http://bit.ly/iN5ju

This latest release from Alaska's Portugal. The Man takes a more straightforward approach than anything the band has does in the past. Though it's all done in the name of being immediate and memorable, I can't really say this album is all that catchy or engaging. It's almost too simple to warrant attention. 2008's Censored Colors saw P.TM playing with some masterfully produced glam/folk/progressive rock sounds, and even 2009's The Satanic Satanist beats American Ghetto in the subtlety department. 

The choppy production and hip hop beats on AG just don't lend  all that much originality to the recording. They weight the songs down instead of propping them up, and dumb down the great melodies and songwriting the band has going. Though I would hate to see the band produced another Censored Colors, giving the music a little more time to breathe and build couldn't hurt.

On Arckanum's fith studio album, titled ÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞ, this one-man band breathes some new life into the classic sounds of BM. Without jumping into the realm of overproduction, this album has some really quality sounds. It's not as alienating as some lo-fi BM recordings may be, and something a range of metal fans could appreciate. There's quite a bit of variation among these tracks, too; it's just enough to make the 50 minutes they span a worthwhile listen. Definitely looking forward to what Arckanum does in the future.

Twitter: http://bit.ly/bmH8y1

Considering this album was coming from a world created by James Mercer and Brian Burton--a.k.a. Danger Mouse--I was expecting a little more from it. Instead of producing a mesh of Burton's studio creativity and Mercer's passionate songwriting, both of these guys use this album to take a backseat. Nothing on this LP burns brightly, takes charge, or attempts to thrill. All in all, it's a pleasant listen, which isn't inherently bad, but Broken Bells only makes for a breezy listen that isn't very engaging. Though the production is clean, and the melodies are agreeable, but I'd be lying to myself if I said this thing stands out.

This latest track from Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti has got me extremely excited for the upcoming album on 4AD. Let's just hope we're not in for another Tomorrow, In A Year. The production on this track makes it extremely surreal, coming off like a lost disco jam full of eccentric vocals. The verse is soft and sensual, but Pink kicks down the walls and raises his hands to heaven for the chorus. It's worth clapping along to, I think. Great sounds, melodies, and structure. A hot jam!

2819,Liars- Sisterworld Review,"http://bit.ly/8ZmDYt
http://bit.ly/codsa8

On Liars' fifth album, the band throws their music into the deepest, darkest, most serpent-filled hole they could possibly find. They create an alternate dimension where eerie sounds and dissonant intervals reign supreme. There are some lush strings, a spot of horns; but Sisterworld revolves mostly around the simplicity of normal rock instrumentation. Yet, it sounds so otherworldly. 

Overall, it lays on the tension a little too much, kind of making it difficult to enjoy. But it would be stupid to assume that wasn't the underlying intent. Though I wasn't able to enjoy that anxiety as much as some people may, I've still got to give kudos to these guys for turning another cohesive concept into an album.

Song that sounds mysteriously close to ""Heartbeats"": http://bit.ly/boZjrv

Stage performance clip: http://bit.ly/3BLCHs

You'll definitely be disappointed in the new Knife album if you go into it expecting to hear what we've come to expect from the Swedish electropop duo. This thing is unreasonably difficult, and never really illustrates as to why. And the few musical moments at the end of the album might sound like sweet relief, but they're only decent in comparison to the 40 plus minutes of unrewarding crap you have to sift through in order to get to them. This album is a childish attempt at avant composition that only exposes the Knife and their collaborators as specs on a map compared to the big names like Zorn, Stockhausen, and Cage. It's just commissioned art project pap, passing itself off as some kind of deep, conceptual piece of music reflecting the work and life of Charles Darwin. The story could be different if I was actually watching the stage show of this performance piece, but as a standalone album, Tomorrow, In a Year just doesn't work.

But this is just my harsh, unforgiving opinion. What did you think of the album? Like it? Hate it? Why?
